Photo credit: Unsplash Although my freelance and academic work for the past few years has focused on the role of universities in tackling local challenges, I’ve begun to think more about how universities can help address the biggest risks to the future existence of humanity.1 This is a big shift: from community engagement on public health to preventing catastrophic pandemics, from improving urban housing to safely managing artificial intelligence. But there’s also much in common, especially around how universities work with government and with each other, how academics and students engage with industry and civil society, and the broader societal role of higher education. Universities can be excellent problem-solvers: locally, nationally and globally.\nMy thoughts on this have also brought me back to my first job after finishing my undergraduate degree in 2008. I helped administer scholarships and fellowships at the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the UK, a scheme that brings individuals to the UK to study at universities (and occasionally hospitals and charities). It’s part of the government’s international development assistance, and is now mainly funded by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). I later wrote an evaluation of scholarships in the health sector, and – in my first bit of consultancy – helped analyse the impact of distance learning scholarships. And in recent years I have been a reading committee member, assessing applications for the FCDO’s Chevening scholarship programme – a sister scheme with soft power objectives.\nI began to think about what a fellowship scheme aimed at tackling the biggest threats to humanity might look like. Instead of development or soft power, the aim would be reducing existential risk by building the capacity and skills of influential individuals by sending them to another organisation (perhaps abroad), or by supporting academic research in under-explored areas (by ‘buying out’ the time of an academic at their own institution). For example: a junior civil servant with promising career prospects in Nigeria spends three months at a biosecurity institute in Europe. Or a historian at a US university spends six months researching the role of diplomatic backchannels in ‘near miss’ nuclear accidents, looking at newly released archives.\nCharacteristics # Here are some early thoughts on the characteristics of such a fellowship scheme. It would be:\nStrategic. Fellows would be selected based on their potential to help solve the biggest threats to humanity. Independent panels of experts would need to help inform what these threats are and assess the potential contribution an individual could make. But a major part of the selection criteria would be career capital – especially skills, connections and credentials (more on career capital here and here). In contrast to other programmes, this means academic merit, career plans or short-term development impact are less important. Instead, fellowships are strategic bets on promising individuals in promising career positions.\nProactive and targeted. The major UK government scholarship programmes are big beasts, bringing thousands of scholars and fellows to the UK a year, and boasting around 80,000 alumni. To begin with (and until an evaluation programme is well underway – see below) numbers would be far smaller. Open calls for applications would be complemented by a headhunting role, ‘recruiting’ exceptional individuals in response to specific needs identified by independent experts.\nDecentralised. The Commonwealth and Chevening programmes bring scholars and fellows to the UK. From a taxpayer perspective this is understandable, as much of the money is recycled into UK universities and local economies. But this programme would be open to fellows anywhere to visit anywhere else – or to stay in-place. It would be administered by a small organisation with a team working remotely. It would be funded by foundations and philanthropists working in the effective altruism community instead of national governments. Decentralisation brings its own complexities (see below), but may help to overcome the perennial – and legitimate – criticism of scholarship programmes that they privilege knowledge produced in the Global North.\nExperimental. A return visit in six months? Reciprocal fellowships for the host to visit the fellow? A roadshow to visit five universities in five months? A secondment to an agency down the road? Nothing would be off the table. Fellowships would be crafted to individual needs, be open to applications all year, and provide generous financial support to both fellow and host. New approaches would be piloted, evaluated, and adapted. Everything would be rigorously evaluated.\nTransparent. Information on what works and what does not work will be shared in the open, alongside all data on applications and spending. Pilots and experiments will be documented and evaluations published. There’s a wealth of learning from existing programmes, and opportunities to build on areas such as counterfactual analysis.\nLong-term. At the same time, there will be a tolerance for long-term and low-probability returns on investment – and an acceptance that some fellows will have no impact on this agenda, and that it will be sometimes impossible to demonstrate impact. Fellows are not mandated to return to their home institution, maintain new connections, or follow any career plan (although they will be supported to do so). The expectation is for a few fellows to have an outsized impact; a few bets will win big.\nConnected. I’ve seen first-hand how decades worth of scholarships provided by Sida, Sweden’s government agency for development, have built the capacity of the University of Rwanda. But this success is as much to do with wider support to infrastructure such as libraries and laboratories as the steady, long-term presence of the agency. If funding is provided in isolation, fellows return home unable to implement what they’ve learned. Awards need to be made with a broad understanding of local context and other activity ongoing in the same space.\nPhoto credit: Unsplash Difficulties # Such a scheme, at least at first, would entail far greater upfront work per fellow than existing programmes. Chevening and Commonwealth enjoy economies of scale, especially as they are both administered by the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU). Open calls need publicising. Headhunting demands time and expertise. Liaising with hosts is time-consuming, especially across borders. A team is needed to manage visas, healthcare insurance, travel arrangements, and support any accompanying family.\nBut the returns could be immense. There is a reason Chevening has been funded since 1983, and Commonwealth since 1960, and that both have survived many changes to government departments and an ever more fiscally challenged Treasury. Nebulous measures such as ‘soft power’ are reflected in (admittedly rudimentary) measures like the number of world leaders educated in the UK (55).\nThe effective altruism community, which spearheads much of this thinking on existential risk, seems to be centred in Oxford and Berkeley. There’s a ridiculous amount of talent that can be brought to bear on global challenges that sits elsewhere, including the Global South. We need diverse experience from different places, the involvement of more institutions – small and specialist institutions alongside large research universities, for example – and a broader blend of academic disciplines.\nNeither is it practical or preferable to bring everyone to the Golden Triangle or the Bay Area. We need experts and advocates in more places, shaping policy in Delhi and Lagos, coordinating, learning, sharing practice, building support and research centres. (And, perhaps in a frame of mind that reflects my recent reading of The Precipice, it seems a little unwise to put all of our longtermist eggs in one basket in the unfortunate case Oxford is destroyed by an unforeseen asteroid.)\nFinally, to return to the obstacles that face a fellowship scheme of the sort I describe, none of these difficulties are insurmountable. In-country fellowships (rather than visiting, or overseas, fellowships) could be prioritised first. Or an organisation such as the ACU can help with logistics. My understanding is that money to fund such programmes is not in short supply, but that the right people and ideas are.\nWhat next? # In summary, I envisage an organisation with two main roles: first facilitating fellowships aimed at reducing the biggest threats to humanity, and second having a transparent and methodological approach to evaluating impact, and sharing this, and trying new approaches. The impact would therefore be twofold: directly growing expertise in more places, and increasing our knowledge of what works when building capacity to tackle existential risks.\nThoughts from others are very welcome. Perhaps something like this already exists. Perhaps there are better alternatives, or better uses of money. But, if not, it seems worthwhile to map out in more detail how a fellowship scheme might work and how.\nInspired largely by the website 80,000 Hours, and Toby Ord’s book The Precipice.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"1 September 2022","permalink":"/posts/risk-fellowships/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"A sketch of what a new form of fellowship provider might look like, and what we can learn from others.","title":"What could a fellowship scheme aimed at tackling the biggest threats to humanity look like?"},{"content":" Available here (external link, PDF).

The Levelling Up White Paper promises to ‘transform derelict urban sites into beautiful communities’, to boost people’s skills, and support local businesses. It also includes a commitment to ‘vastly simplify the local growth funding landscape’.\nMuch of this funding will be channelled through the UK Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF), the successor to EU Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). But concerns have been raised about reduced funding pots, shorter timeframes and superficial objectives. Local growth funding matters for universities, who have a track record of delivering skills and employment programmes, innovation and incubation centres, and many other projects at local level. Using HESA data we can visualise the scale of this activity over the past six years.\nFor the past four years regeneration income – funding awarded to universities to spend on local development projects – has increased, to a total of £292m in 2020 (figure 1). Based on these figures, regeneration funding is forecast to total £2.5 billion over the next five years. But, as Universities UK have stressed, progress is threatened by funding gaps between local growth programmes. Figure 1: the size of regeneration spend over time We can track the funding of individual higher education providers over time (figure 2). Whilst the picture is a little messy, it tells us several important things. First, that whilst relative rankings can shift, for many institutions their spending in this area is consistent from year-to-year – shown by the thickness of each band. Second, the ten providers with the highest level of regeneration income in 2020 accounted for over £143m of activity – nearly half of the total. Sitting at the top is the University of Birmingham (with around a third of its regeneration funding from ESIF), followed by the universities of Swansea (nearly all from ESIF) and Ulster (about a fifth from ESIF). Figure 2: regeneration spending for all providers Given the focus of levelling up policy and the UKSPF on reducing spatial inequalities, breaking this data down by region and UK nation shows us areas where expertise is at risk of being lost through reduced funding, and other areas where investment should be boosted (figure 3 – each band represents a provider). The West Midlands performs strongly, powered in large part by the University of Birmingham. London, Northern Ireland, the South East and Wales show sharp rises in recent years, in some cases due to an individual provider scaling up their activity. Figure 3: regeneration income by regions and nations These figures obscure some smaller providers punching above their weight. If we adjust regeneration income on the basis of student numbers, the Royal Veterinary College jumps to the top (figure 4). Hartpury University and Hartpury College, a specialist agriculture and veterinary institution in Gloucester, also ranks high. Figure 4: regeneration income scaled by student numbers Sitting behind these figures are staff with deep expertise on how universities can work with partners to transform funding streams into local impact. When we shifted from the 2007-2013 to the 2014-2020 ESIF funding cycles, the ‘gap’ in funding led to widespread fears of this expertise leaving universities, with long-lasting implications for local areas. This time, given the radical change in funding programmes, the gap risks becoming a chasm.\nA version of this post originally appeared on the NCEE website.\nNote on sources: The data on income from regeneration and development programmes is from the HESA Higher Education - Business and Community Interaction survey 2019/20. Totals exclude capital income attributable to survey year – some of the tables may look quite different if this is included. Note also that these totals do not necessarily include all local development activity funded by higher education providers. Income is also somewhat dependent on allocations made to local areas through the likes of the ESIF and Local Growth Fund programmes. The data on student numbers is from the 2020/21 HESA student dataset. Timelines are academic years – 2015/16 becomes 2016.

No further train analogies. This post originally appeared on the NCEE website.\nThe government published the Levelling Up White Paper today. Given the delays (the paper was expected last year) much ink has been spilled on what it should say. Most agree the challenge is immense: as Professor Philip McCann observes, ‘no other large industrialised country faces such productivity inequalities over such a tiny space’. Most also welcome a focus on tackling some of the long-standing structural issues facing our society. These issues have a very human side: recent work has explored feelings of trauma and grief felt by people whose local industries have collapsed in ‘left behind’ places.\nMuch will be written in the coming days on whether the white paper goes far enough to meet this challenge. My initial impression is that it makes the right noises in terms of the mechanisms to make this happen – a roadmap for devolution across England, a focus on ‘system’ change cutting across government departments, and adopting a mission-led approach to tackling an incredibly complex challenge. But the lack of any substantial new financial muscle underpinning this is worrying, especially if local councils are expected to do more at a time when many are reeling under financial pressure. Here are a few other quick observations.\nResearch and development # One mission is for domestic public R\u0026amp;D investment outside the Greater South East to increase by at least 40% by 2030. This is accompanied by a commitment from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to invest at least 55% of their domestic R\u0026amp;D funding outside the region by 2024-25. This welcome announcement follows hints dropped in the government’s innovation strategy and spending review, and numerous influential policy reports over the past few years, not least Nesta’s on the missing £4 billion. Historic underfunding in some regions has led to inequalities in economic performance across the UK. New Innovation Accelerators, ‘major place-based centres of innovation’, in Greater Manchester, the West Midlands, and Glasgow-City Region are a further step to reversing this damage. They need substantial funding: will £100m between three be enough – particularly if they aim to follow the university-centred models of MIT-Greater Boston and Stanford-Silicon Valley? Evidence suggests this is a very challenging ambition. Tracking progress # The influence of Neil O’Brien MP, Boris Johnson’s Levelling Up Adviser and head of the No. 10/Cabinet Office Unit leading on levelling up, is clear. O’Brien was involved in Nesta’s report on the missing £4 billion, but has also written extensively in the past on how progress on levelling up should be measured. Sure enough, missions will be ‘underpinned by a suite of public metrics to track progress and monitor the evolution of spatial disparities’. There will be an annual report updating the public on the progress of these missions and an advisory council, including academics, will provide ‘further support and constructive analysis’. This data will need to be very carefully tuned to capture the right information, and it will need to be sufficiently granular to be useful to local places (remembering, of course, that some of the most uneven places are within the Greater South East). But, again, this is a welcome move. Business, spin-offs and SMEs # Local businesses, spin-offs and SMEs will drive the success of the new innovation clusters and the Shared Prosperity Fund, generating new ideas and technologies, providing jobs, and helping regenerate local areas. Universities play a key role in supporting these enterprises. But the UK’s highly centralised economic geography hurts businesses in higher education cold spots. Research shows businesses located a greater geographic distance from universities employ fewer skilled workers and are less effectively managed. And will the £2.6 billion in the Shared Prosperity Fund to replace EU structural funds be enough for all parts of the UK, in particular those nations and regions designated as less developed or transitioning under the EU programme?\nUniversities need to be proactive in bridging these gaps. Our forthcoming leadership survey report confirms that universities take this agenda seriously: developing new local partnerships and collaborations ranks fourth (out of 17 priorities) in terms of how important activities are likely to be over the next couple of years. At NCEE, we are launching a new programme of enterprise work, and stand ready to support the sector to help local areas prosper.\n","date":"2 February 2022","permalink":"/posts/next-white-paper-arriving-in-uk/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"First thoughts on the government’s flagship Levelling Up White Paper.","title":"The next White Paper arriving in the UK is the delayed Department for Levelling Up strategy calling at the red wall, ‘left behind’ places, and forgotten communities"},{"content":"Today a report I wrote for Yorkshire Universities was published, looking at how universities can help attract inward investment and boost trade.

Photo credit: Unsplash Hotel Viru in Tallinn, Estonia has a museum on the top floor. There are rows of tape recorders on little desks: KGB listening posts to spy on the international guests staying downstairs. The hidden microphone in a hotel room features in countless spy novels and thriller films; the private space rendered public.\nWe have a fascination with big hotels. There is a BBC television series looking at the world’s most luxurious hotels. The Grand Budapest Hotel won four Oscars and A Gentleman in Moscow was a worldwide bestseller.\nUniversities, museums and hospitals are often described as anchor institutions, a term meaning a large organisation rooted in a place and which coordinates economic and social activity. We can easily apply this definition to large hotels. Hotels are a very different form of anchor institution to a university. But they can play an outsized role in national and city development.\nIn tourist destinations, the hotel bed is the primary unit on which an entire industry, sometimes an entire economy, is built. In war zones, the hotel bar is often the meeting place for reporters and diplomats, a place for gossip, negotiations and deal-making. Hotels boast of the world leaders that have visited; conferences held in hotels have led to peace and failed to prevent war. The conversations that have taken place in hotel corridors and over drinks have led to scientists, artists and businesspeople working together for the first time, with Nobel prizes or IPOs following a decade later. New governments form in hotels.\nDescribing Uganda in a time of civil war, Michaela Wrong writes:\nwith their emergency generators, satellite dishes, wine cellars, and stocks of tinned food, big hotels are natural magnets for invading guerrilla forces, offering services that have collapsed in looted government offices and private residences.\nA leader from a private university in Africa recently told me how he views the five star hotels in his city as ‘nexuses of power’, part of the government’s well-oiled machine to attract investment by bringing important people together.\nOf course, there’s more to the anchor role than providing a bed for a prime minister. But even on these points, universities can tell a powerful story. They can boast of their presidential graduates. They can be centres of peace and reconciliation: I remember vividly a Sri Lankan Vice Chancellor speaking over a decade ago at a conference (held not at a hotel, but the University of Cape Town) about how his university campus was a sanctuary for people fleeing violence during the civil war. But it would be a mistake to think that universities are the only important anchor institution in town.\nAnother short piece of mine has been published today: an article for Science and Engineering South on the role of universities in the south of England in economic recovery (drawing on my publication for Universities UK).\n","date":"29 September 2021","permalink":"/posts/concierges-and-wine-cellars/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"Hotels can also play an outsized role in national and city development.","title":"Concierges and wine cellars: universities are not the only anchors in town"},{"content":" Available here (external link).

This post originally appeared on the Yorkshire Universities website.\nThe contribution of business is vital if the UK is to meet its target of R\u0026amp;D investment reaching 2.4 percent of GDP by 2027. International comparisons suggest that this is an ambitious target, that will be difficult to meet: achieving R\u0026amp;D funding goals is the exception rather than the norm. Adão Carvalho assessed how effective R\u0026amp;D intensity policies were across 45 countries, and found that 84 percent missed their targets. For 17 percent of countries, R\u0026amp;D intensity actually decreased over the period of the target.\nAs the business sector is the largest funder of R\u0026amp;D (54 percent), and performs 67 percent of R\u0026amp;D activity, we need to consider how universities can encourage and retain further private sector investment. One means is through inward investment. Foreign-owned businesses in the UK spend nearly as much on R\u0026amp;D activity as UK-owned businesses – 45 percent of the total.\nRecent work has put the role of universities in inward investment efforts higher on the agenda. A statement by Core Cities UK and 24 universities called for a UK Urban Trade and Investment Strategy. The National Centre for Universities and Business R\u0026amp;D Taskforce report asked government to develop a foreign direct investment in R\u0026amp;D strategy to attract more business investment to R\u0026amp;D in the UK.\nMore broadly, the topics of place promotion and inward investment intersect with the levelling up agenda, discussions of place, innovation and of shaping the UK’s post-Brexit, post-COVID future. The UK Innovation Strategy has a section dedicated to attracting foreign direct investment. And the role of inward investment in supporting levelling up has come under scrutiny from the House of Commons International Trade Committee, given the wide variations in investment across UK regions. A report published last week by the Committee emphasises the role of universities, and it draws on evidence provided by Yorkshire Universities (you can read our full submission here).\nWith three-quarters of YU members located in the Leeds City Region, maximising the potential of this large-scale cluster of institutions to attract new investment is critical to Yorkshire and the Humber contributing towards the national 2.4% target. Experimental data suggests West Yorkshire now ranks sixth amongst UK city regions for inward investment. At Yorkshire Universities we are working with regional leaders to maximise the contribution of our higher education institutions to increased trade and inward investment. We’ll soon be publishing a discussion paper, Universities and ‘Place Promotion’ in West Yorkshire, that sets out some of the key issues and provides practical and immediate actions going forwards.

I wanted to call this post ‘how to dramatically slash interview transcription times’. However, transcription – at least in an academic setting – is often a process of generating new ideas and uncovering layers of understanding at the same time as you go through your recording word-for-word. It’s a messy and time-consuming task, but there are technical steps you can take to speed it up. (For my policy work I often don’t transcribe at all – this is the best way to slash your transcription times).\nOver the past few months I’ve had hours and hours of interviews to transcribe, and this is my system for doing it as painlessly as possible.\nFirst: automatic transcription # The pandemic has forced interviews online, but thankfully both Zoom and Teams offer inbuilt transcription. You’ll want to host the meeting yourself to ensure you’re able to record the meeting, and of course seek permission to do so. You can then generate and download a transcript soon after the meeting finishes.\nIf you’re using a dictaphone, there are a raft of online automatic transcription services. Otter, Sonix and Ebby are three examples. If your interview is particularly sensitive you’ll want to check the relevant data security and storage policies of the service you choose.\nA major benefit of transcription from Zoom or Teams is the accurate labelling of who said what. Some other services claim to be able to do this using machine learning, but online conversations will always split conversations flawlessly because the sound of each participant is saved as a different channel – unlike a dictaphone. Transcription isn\u0026rsquo;t always flattering. Second: initial clean # Transcription files are usually a .vtt file. There are timestamps and other metadata smeared everywhere. You can clean this up using an online tool called Microsoft Stream transcript VTT file cleaner, which strips out the time codes, metadata, and extra lines and gives you a solid block of text.\nI prefer do a quick clean using a text editor. For the uninitiated, a text editor gives you magical powers to manipulate text files – you can move, tidy, and change thousands of words in seconds. You can fly around huge documents with ninja-like speed. I use Sublime Text, but VS Code and Atom are open source alternatives. Microsoft Word is not a text editor.\nIt’s worth learning the basics of whichever text editor you pick, but support for multiple cursors, regular expressions and extensions are standard. I remove all the timestamps and other cruft, change the speaker names (from \u0026lt;Smith, John\u0026gt; to Interviewee:, for example), and save the file as text (.rtf). If you notice any repeated errors, for example I often find Rwanda is transcribed as Rhonda, you can fix these all in one go too. This process takes no more than a couple of minutes – a fraction of what it would take to change everything manually.\nThird: review # Automatic transcription is pretty advanced – at least compared to ten years ago. But it will still need fixing. At the very least words will be wrong and some entire sentences garbled. You might also want to remove verbal fillers (people, including myself, say ‘yeah’ way more than I realised). I also found that transcription is more accurate for native English speakers from the UK and North America, suggesting some bias in the machine learning used.\nI use a free application called Transcriptions for Mac to review my recordings; similar options should be available for Windows. You load the text file transcript and your audio recording, and play it back, checking the accuracy. Some advice:\nFind a playback speed that allows you to correct on-the-fly, without needing to keep stopping and starting the recording. When you get into the flow you’ll tackle the whole text much quicker (an hour interview is usually 7,000 - 10,000 words). Around 0.75x usually worked for me. Learn the keyboard shortcuts to stop and start the recording, and to go back 10 seconds. You’ll need the last one to check anything that’s unclear, and not having to use the mouse/trackpad to find the relevant buttons will save lots of time on a less-than-crystal-clear transcription. In my interviews I usually ask around 10 questions. After each I add a timestamp (using another keyboard shortcut in the application). This allows you to later review the original recording if need be, and in the Transcriptions application you can click the timestamp to be taken to that part of the recording. Sometimes you’ll come across a name that keeps on getting garbled by the automatic transcription. It’s a pain to have to type out _ International Bank for Reconstruction and Development_ every time it’s wrong, and if it gets mangled into a different form every time, the find-and-replace function from above won’t help. Here substitutions are great: set a couple of characters, e.g. -ib, and this will automatically be expanded to _ International Bank for Reconstruction and Development_. This feature is built into Transcriptions, I use Alfred on the Mac (where the feature is called snippets), and there are loads for Windows – just search for ‘text expander’. The Transcriptions interface Fourth: finalising # Once I have a complete and accurate transcript, I move the text back into Sublime Text and finalise it. Again, this is a speedy step that should take ten minutes.\nI save the file as Markdown (.md). Now two clever (and free) Sublime Text extensions come into play: MarkdownEditing and Markdown​TOC. Using a Markdown subheading (###) I add in around ten topic headers – where the conversation moves into a new subject, or changes direction and I’ll want to find it again easily. Adding in topic headers Then using simple syntax I can generate a table of contents. Automatic TOC creation based on markdown headers Finally I quickly change the speaker names into italics (using multiple selections), make the timestamps bold (using regular expressions), and sometimes I’ll add in URLs to specific projects or organisations that have been discussed. I double check the interviewee’s name has been redacted throughout – you may, of course, not need to do this. Tidying the text Using the wizardry of Pandoc (or the excellent DocDown if you want a command-line-free alternative for Mac), the Markdown file is transformed into a Microsoft Word file for easy sharing. The transcript in Word\u0026hellip; You’ll notice that the table of contents is automatically created. \u0026hellip;with a hyperlinked TOC Some of this is a little technical, and I’ve passed over some detail to keep this relatively concise.

This post originally appeared on the Yorkshire Universities website.\nPoliticians are fond of comparing the UK to Germany – usually as a model of how we could do something better. A recent example is Boris Johnson’s speech on levelling up from last month. “I remember going to former East Germany in 1990 just after the wall had gone down”, he said, “and I remember being amazed at how far behind west Germany it then was – a place of strange little cars with two stroke engines and fake coffee”. But then he adds, “to a large extent Germany has succeeded in levelling up where we have not”.\nIt is helpful to look a little more closely at the process of levelling up in Germany. Thomas Fischer has written about the staggering numbers involved. First, the process took decades. It was underpinned by a political agreement known as the ‘Solidarity Treaty’, and ran from 1995 until COVID struck in 2019. Second, it cost an estimated 1.5 trillion euros of public money (some estimates run even higher). Needless to say, the German model of levelling up – let’s call it the solidarity path – requires immense public funding, and a long-term vision spanning multiple generations.\nThere’s a second path to levelling up. Will Jennings and colleagues describe it as ‘spectacle politics’, expressing concern that the levelling up agenda means picking a few places to level up in order to craft a story of success in time for the next election. This might work to increase the Conservative Party’s chances of re-election (but the electorate, Jennings adds, will catch on at some point), but will do little to address the serious need for redistribution between people or regions, or reverse the uneven dynamics of economic development.\nThe solidarity path and spectacle path represent two courses of action for the government, and there are many possible paths that sit between the two. The direction will become clearer in the White Paper on Levelling Up, expected later in the year. But the track record of government on the topic is not encouraging. If we want levelling up to be more than the next ‘big society’, we need to hope for more solidarity than spectacle.\n","date":"12 August 2021","permalink":"/posts/solidarity-or-spectacle/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"Reflections on strange little cars and fake coffee.","title":"Solidarity or spectacle – two paths to levelling up"},{"content":" Current approaches to local engagement are impeded by outdated strategic planning models. It was good to speak again at the UIIN University-Industry Interaction Conference this morning. Last year I spoke about the pitfalls of local economic impact studies commissioned by universities, and today I talked about how current approaches to local engagement are impeded by outdated strategic planning models. Although ‘place’ needs to be central to local activity, approaches to this are strangely place-neutral: a series of engagement strategies and university planning documents that are largely indistinguishable from one another.\nThis thinking builds on several threads from the past few years: on strategies, on impact studies, and on understanding obstacles and opportunities for engagement.\nIt’s always fun to be able to say slightly controversial things like “the current crop of impact studies, engagement strategies, and enterprise policies emerging from universities risk becoming an arms race to local irrelevance”. But the point is a serious one. A uniform approach to engagement and enterprise masks what is really important at a local level: understanding and helping those who are marginalised, reaching out to those who can benefit from the work of universities, and understanding what more universities can do to help places and the communities who live in them.\nI presented three tools for universities to help bridge engagement and enterprise at the local level. These are saved here together with the slides and an earlier presentation I gave back in February at Teesside University on a similar topic. Two of the tools I have talked about before, but the third tool – open source checklists for universities – is a new one I will revisit in a future post.\n","date":"16 June 2021","permalink":"/posts/arms-race-local-irrelevance/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"Current approaches to local engagement are impeded by outdated strategic planning models.","title":"An arms race towards local irrelevance"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2021","permalink":"/places/germany/","section":"Places","summary":"","title":"Germany"},{"content":" Exploring the potential impact of university partnerships over the next five years.

Update July 2022: this post describes my move from hosting my website on Wordpress to HEY World. I have now moved everything to Hugo, a static site generator. However, much of the same thinking still applies. My blog has moved home. Part of the reason for this is rethinking how I do communications around my research and consultancy work, and my PhD. It’s also part of a drive towards simplifying things.\nThis blog will pick up what I talked about on the old site, but perhaps with shorter and more frequent posts. These will be a mixture of announcing new work or publications, sharing interesting things, and technical or process-related workflows. This first post is a bit different, and offers some reflections on how my approach to blogging and communications has changed over time.\nOld blog, new blog # I started my Wordpress site in 2015, and posted 80 times – around 36,000 words. Of the roughly 12,000 views, 3,700 (or 30 percent) of these were for a single post, about my academic writing workflow. The second most popular post was about creating maps. Clearly if my main motivation was attracting page views, I should focus on tutorials.\nHowever, chasing views is not my focus. My core writing, on the local role of universities, in unlikely to go viral anytime soon. The main motivation is to force myself to solidify thoughts into a coherent enough form that I am happy to publish them. Some posts are the early thinking around which paid projects or larger reports are built, and others are picked up elsewhere and reach a wider audience. In any case, nothing quite beats publishing on more established sites for exposure to a wider audience – my two articles on The Conversation, for example, have been viewed 45,000 times (a reflection on the reach of the site, rather than myself).\nYet Wordpress nudges you towards tracking your views and your visitors and a range of other metrics. Beautifully designed posts and pages are within reach with little expertise needed, but can end up sucking up lots of time to create. Masses of menus offer infinite customisation and functionality. I wanted something quicker and cleaner.\nThis site is hosted through HEY World, a new service linked to my email account. It is lighting fast, very simple, and doesn’t track anything. Readers are encouraged to receive posts by email (or RSS), and these look like any other plain email – no need to click through to the site, no trackers or cookies or anything else. But the essential idea remains: a repository for my ideas, and hopefully some people will find it useful. Just a little less time spent on communication processes, and more time writing.\nOld tools, new tools # I’ve long been a fan of Cal Newport and his thinking on deep work and our relationship with technology. His well-reasoned advice is at odds with much of the well-meaning advice often thrown the way of people setting up their own freelance businesses: that you need to have a strong social media presence, you need to cultivate your brand, and that you need to be an expert marketer to succeed.\nHere’s an example in practice. Many, especially working in research and policy, view Twitter as an essential tool. Yet Twitter became an early victim of my streamlined communications strategy. Maybe I was just bad at using it, but it always felt like I was shouting into a big empty room. I deleted my account a few years ago, and it was strangely satisfying.\nHowever, Twitter has one very useful purpose: finding out about things – policies, projects – that other people are doing, and which aren’t posted elsewhere. Most things I can pick up via RSS or Google Alerts or email newsletters, but sometimes a personal perspective is needed. For this I use the excellent NetNewsWire – a speedy open source RSS reader for Mac that can treat Twitter feeds as RSS feeds. I can then read these bundled together with everything else a couple of times a week.\nMy strategy is to produce more original work with less of the time-consuming, distraction-inducing overheads and processes that traditionally surround it. This blog is one part of the picture.\n","date":"25 May 2021","permalink":"/posts/my-communications-strategy/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"Reducing time-consuming, distraction-inducing overheads.","title":"My communications strategy – do less communications"},{"content":" Validating work with rigorous evidence I had the good fortune to be sat next to David Chaplin on a flight from Rwanda last year.

Photo of tables (tenuous, I know): Unsplash This post originally appeared on the Yorkshire Universities website.\nIn July 2020, Yorkshire Universities, the Yorkshire \u0026amp; Humber Academic Health Science Network and the NHS Confederation published Levelling Up Yorkshire and Humber: health as the new wealth post-COVID. The report set out the bold actions that are needed by local and national leadership to embed a renewed focus on health, tackle long-standing regional inequalities, and boost future investment in Yorkshire’s health and life sciences assets as we begin living with and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHowever, and like an unpublished manuscript by a famous author found in a car boot sale, or a previously-lost live recording appearing in a dusty storage unit, there was also an annex to the report that, although never included in the final document, nevertheless heavily-informed the analysis and recommendations.\nAlthough the report had a particular focus on the tricky but vital mechanics of cross-sector collaboration – bringing together universities, local government, the health and care sector, business and communities – we also developed 12 examples of how activity could be started, extended and embedded in practice.\nThese examples are rooted in efforts to improve health outcomes, but they illustrate how different activities can evolve and strengthen and they can be adapted to different sectors and varying local needs. However, the traditional wisdom of carefully nurturing partnerships over time needs also to be balanced by the types of rapid response and new partnerships forged in the response to COVID-19.\nAs activities progress, they start to involve a wider range of local partners, they focus more attention on the broader determinants of health (i.e. on prevention rather than simply on the cure), the approach becomes more proactive than reactive, and partners adopt a longer-term perspective.\nFor example, here’s activity number 10. The starting point:\nAcademics and other specialists are involved in tackling local health challenges.\nHere’s how it can be extended:\nStudents and industry partners are also involved in designing and implementing responses. Work is done with rather than for or to communities. This work includes activity – such as citizen science – related to examining the social determinants of health, in particular things like improved housing.\nAnd how it can be further embedded:\nThere is a programme of work on anticipating and proactively responding to long-term challenges to health and wellbeing in the region, and communicating challenges and opportunities with partners within and beyond the region. A stronger focus on ‘place’ is promoted as a determinant of national research and innovation funding and activity. Regional partners should collectively make the case to attract greater investment in R\u0026amp;D and innovation funding for health.\nThe table can be viewed here.

Photo credit: Unsplash This post originally appeared on the Yorkshire Universities website.\nAsk anyone in a university working on local growth or community engagement whether having dedicated funding for this activity makes their life easier, and you’ll nearly always be told it does. The same person may also bemoan the amount of red tape, small print and complexity involved with this funding – but the benefits of European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), for example, outweighed the bureaucratic headaches and university engagement in ESIF grew year after year.\nBut what is the path to beginning a programme of local engagement work in an institution with no dedicated funding? What are the barriers and institutional hurdles that need to be overcome? And how do the broader concerns of a university facilitate or hinder this work?\nThe following decision tree provides a starting framework in which to consider these questions. It gives an example of the decisions and circumstances that exist before a university starts a programme of local engagement work. Individual universities may choose to skip all or part of the tree, or begin their path from a different starting point – that is, somewhere other than at the very top.\nLocal engagement decision tree for universities (click here for larger PDF version) There are two key points. First, unless an institution can secure dedicated funding up front, the path to beginning a programme of work is both lengthy and complex, with numerous hurdles. Given the scale of ‘levelling up’ challenges we face, coupled with the end of European funding for local growth, this means clarification on the scope and scale of the UK Shared Prosperity Fund is essential. Second, an effective and sustainable programme requires institutional support, staff or student willingness, and appropriate resources. Eschewing any one of these three pillars hinders local engagement.\nThe decision tree is part of my PhD research, and has received valuable input from colleagues in Rwanda and the UK. As such, it is designed to be equally applicable to, for example, a small creative arts institution in the UK and a large multi-faculty African university. But it is also a work in progress, and feedback is very much welcome – via email, in the comments below, or, for the more technically-minded, by submitting a pull request in the Github repository (explanatory notes and a larger PDF version of the tree are also available here).\n","date":"7 January 2021","permalink":"/posts/visualising-path-local-engagement/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"Before local development work can start, institutional support, staff or student willingness, and appropriate resources are needed.","title":"Visualising a path to local engagement"},{"content":"","date":"30 December 2020","permalink":"/types/journal-article/","section":"Types","summary":"","title":"Journal Article"},{"content":" Available here (external link, PDF).

The full report has eight case studies (see my previous posts on Pittsburgh and Israel). Individually, they tell the story of how the actions of leaders, businesses, universities and communities have affected the development of different places with different contexts and histories. Combined, patterns and trends begin to emerge. The story of Uppsala in Sweden is one of a long history of industry and academia working closely together.\nThe life science industry in the Stockholm-Uppsala region began to attract international headlines in the early 2000s. A special section in Nature lauded the ‘world class scientific and business environment’.1 The Economist described Uppsala alongside Cambridge in the UK as one of the most biotech-dense cities in the world.2\nThe region is Sweden\u0026rsquo;s largest life science cluster, home to just over half of the country’s life science industry (over 20,000 employees), five universities and 650 life science companies.3 Over the past decade, 15 to 20 new life science companies were formed in the region each year.4 Stockholm-Uppsala usually ranks in top ten European biopharma clusters, and the sector was recognised as a national priority with the establishment of an Office for Life Sciences in 2019.5\nDespite the concentration of academic and industry activity, opinions differ on whether the cluster should be defined as an ‘Uppsala cluster’ or as part of the wider Stockholm-Uppsala region. We will refer to the Uppsala cluster, whilst recognising that activity spans different spatial dimensions: from informal networking and labour market dynamics at a regional level, to business and academic relationships that span the globe.6 Uppsala itself is just 70km from Stockholm and activities often bridge the two. With an international reputation as ‘the city of methods’ due to a traditional focus on the production of biotech research tools, Uppsala has a long history of industry and academia working closely together.7\nThe cluster builds on Sweden’s solid foundation for life sciences research. The country has a good environment for conducting clinical trials, and has invested in electronic patient records and similar databases. Intellectual property rules allow researchers to retain patent rights in their work – seen by some as encouraging entrepreneurship, but by others as blocking technology transfer. And the country ranks fifth in Europe for the number of products in its clinical development pipeline.8 Upon this foundation, but with roots stretching back to the 1920s and periods of growth and uncertainty, the Uppsala cluster emerged.\nDevelopment # The Uppsala life sciences cluster has much in common with the development of other notable clusters: a strong university research base, a proliferation of innovative firms, and key individuals who mobilise and attract funding and garner wider interest in their work. It also has a popular origin story of a cluster born out of adversity – when in reality the life sciences activity in the region today is the product of decades of work (Pittsburgh has a similar narrative).\nHowever, the literature on Uppsala has a pronounced focus on three elements in particular: institutional changes and restructuring over time, the impact of the media, and the role of cluster initiative bodies. The story of Sweden’s largest life sciences cluster will be told through these areas of focus.\nThe roots of the cluster can be traced to biotech research conducted at Uppsala University during the 1920s and 1930s. However, larger-scale industrial activity was sparked by the Swedish pharmaceutical company Pharmacia relocating from Stockholm to Uppsala in the 1950s. A major reason for the move was a history of collaboration between Pharmacia and a research unit at Uppsala University built on the contribution of two Swedish Nobel Laureates in chemistry: Theodor Svedberg and Arne Tiselius.9\nIn 1995 Pharmacia, then one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in Europe, merged with the US company Upjohn, leading to protracted restructuring and relocating – including the move of some R\u0026amp;D and marketing activities to the US.10 Product and research focus shifted to match those of the new owners. The company adopted an American business culture: ‘competence originated at the top of the company and filtered down through the organisation’ – at odds with the Scandinavian culture of delegated decision-making.11 Around 200 research and managerial positions were moved out of Uppsala; the move was initially seen as striking a huge blow to the region.12\nThe merger was the culmination of a series of spin-offs, reorganisations and sales, significantly changing the life science landscape of the region. As Pharmacia withdrew, a new narrative began to emerge. Former Pharmacia researchers and managers, it was perceived, were freed from their corporate shackles and channelled their energy into new enterprises; the vacuum left by company’s withdrawal led to a frenzy of entrepreneurial start-ups and innovative ideas.13 Soon after, there was an influx of new capital to the cluster, further boosting the growth of life science research and enterprise in the region.\nThe reality is slightly more complex. As subsequent research has found, the capital was not sourced locally, but from foreign investors and venture capital firms in the greater Stockholm region attracted by the technologies developed at Pharmacia.14 And, in a detailed deconstruction of the popular narrative, Alexandra Waluszewski has shown how the emergence of the Uppsala cluster is not simply the result of (or the aftermath of) a single critical event, but the interaction of ‘stable and healthy’ industrial and academic units over at least 70 years.15 She concludes that:\na closer look at the ‘‘new’’ life science/biotech companies’ population in the Uppsala region reveals that most of them have a long history. The majority have their resource roots in projects initiated long before the restructuring of Pharmacia. Many of them have existed for decades, sometimes as visible companies, sometimes hidden as projects within different parts of the universities or companies. The small company Medical Products Octagon is an illustrative example. The company was established in 1971 but existed as a project in the early 1960s. As one of the initiators, Professor Uno Erikson, explains: ‘‘We were many researchers with our daily work at the University hospital, within such disciplines as anaesthesia, physiology, radiology, cardiology, etc., and continually experienced technological problems connected to available equipment and material. It was this displeasure, and particularly all the negative effects we saw on the patients, that triggered us to use our medical knowledge for the development of new technological solutions. However, for decades we were forced to handle this work—development of new solutions, patents and licenses—in secrecy. For a professor at Uppsala University running a business was regarded as very suspect’’.16\nAs such, several key organisations including Uppsala University and its research hospital, the University of Agriculture, the biotech instrument producer GE Healthcare, and Phadia (blood test systems) have acted as ‘anchor’ institutions, and have had an important role in the formation of many new companies.17 This includes through spin-outs, knowledge generation and dissemination, and access to research labs, but also customer and supplier connections, sharing of prototyping expertise and production facilities, and business support and advice. Growth has also been stimulated by governmental agencies located in Uppsala, including the National Veterinary Institute and the Medical Products Agency.18\nHowever, this does not diminish the importance of Pharmacia in shaping Uppsala’s life sciences cluster. Both GE Healthcare and Phadia have their roots in Pharmacia’s restructuring (and interactions with Uppsala University’s Department of Biochemistry); Pharmacia itself is now part of Pfizer and retains a presence in the region. Indeed, seven of the ten largest companies have some form of Pharmacia heritage.19 A second legacy is the significant local knowledge pool in several biotech areas; the development of specialised methods, instruments, and research tools is considered the traditional core of the cluster and underpins Uppsala’s reputation as a ‘city of methods’, whilst differentiating it from national competitors.20\nThe role of the media is a second, and related, theme in discussions of Uppsala’s cluster development. Initial media coverage portrayed the 1995 Pharmacia merger as a crisis and a devastating blow for the region, asking questions of the trustworthiness and strategy of company directors. By 1998 stories reflected a narrative of a community united and collaborating to shape the future: that Pharmacia relocating was ‘the best thing that could have happened to Uppsala’, and ‘laid-off researchers in Uppsala have turned local developments around’.21\nRegardless of whether this ‘catalytic event’ narrative reflected the reality, it had an impact. The expanding biotech sector in Uppsala became a hot topic. It affected how government actors engaged in regional development and infrastructure planning in Uppsala. It influenced how customers, suppliers, venture capitalists and potential employees viewed the cluster.22 As such, the media helped to construct a ‘perceived regional advantage’, providing the necessary channels to ‘promote investment opportunities and attract new capital’.23 Several bodies, including STUNS (the Foundation for Collaboration between the Universities in Uppsala, Business and the Public Sector) and the Chambers of Commerce, have been linked to commissioning media articles on the region’s biotech resurgence during this period.24\nA third factor is the part played by cluster initiatives: collaborations between public and private sector bodies, including government agencies, universities and companies, to improve the competitiveness of clusters. Uppsala BIO was created in 2003 by local representatives from government, industry, and academia.25 Cluster initiatives raise the awareness of the work within a cluster, provide platforms for dialogue and decision-making (especially around the business environment), and perform the important intermediary activities of brokerage, facilitation and promotion.26 A study of Swedish cluster initiatives found successful bodies struck a balance between being relevant for members and being open to new perspectives; Uppsala BIO offers training and networking for Uppsala’s life science industry, but also ‘open house’ networking and knowledge-exchange activities.27 Promotion and marketing has been an important thread in Uppsala’s life sciences cluster development, and Uppsala BIO is part of this continued effort. But this cluster initiative also reinforces the foundation upon which the cluster has grown: a long history of universities and industry working together.\nOutcomes # There have been notable outcomes throughout the history of the Uppsala cluster. Swedish academics have found that the cluster played an important role in national economic restructuring from the 1970s, and was the engine of national life science growth.28 Specifically, academic and industry collaboration led to the discovery of Sephadex, a gel filtration medium, in 1959, and immunoglobulin E, used to diagnose and treat allergies, in 1967. And this collaboration more generally led to the growth of Pharmacia as one of Europe’s largest pharmaceutical companies, an important actor in the economic growth of the region, and a convenor of talented researchers and managers. As such, Pharmacia has been described as ‘the third University’ in Uppsala (together with Uppsala University and the Swedish Agricultural University).29\nThe result today is a mature ecosystem. There are several markers of this. First, the growth of specialised services firms in and around the cluster, including in business development, patenting and legal advice, recruitment and marketing.30 Specialised consultancy firms also help to fill gaps within biotechnology start-ups.31 A second marker is the growth of informal contact between industry and academia, built over time on the foundations of formal relationships. The result of this physical and social proximity is the rapid circulation and spillover of knowledge and ideas within the cluster, well-developed social networks, and easy access to global contacts and channels. Individuals can easily switch firms and move from industry to academia and vice versa, transferring knowledge and further strengthening relationships.32\nDespite strong collaboration and professional mobility within the cluster, there are differences between public and private sector organisations, and – as one might expect – differing views on the priorities and strengths of the cluster. Their interactions differ too, perhaps to the overall benefit of the cluster. Public sector organisations tend to interact more with biotech companies at a national level than their private sector counterparts, whereas private sector companies interact more often with biotech companies at an international level. Both, however, rank the cluster’s work in developing methods and tools for discovery as the greatest strength, followed by diagnostic work.33\nLooking forward # The Uppsala cluster is closely intertwined with inward investment efforts from Invest Stockholm and other bodies, in targeted areas such as applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to life sciences, and health tech.34 This builds on Stockholm-Uppsala Life Science (SULS), a joint effort between Uppsala BIO and Stockholm city to actively market the region’s life science outside of Sweden which began in 2007.35\nPrevious analyses have found that the venture capital sector in Uppsala is heavily underdeveloped in terms of the number of local actors.36 However, this is perhaps symptomatic of the country as a whole, rather than an issue of local provision: an earlier study found that 84 percent of venture capital invested in Swedish drug discovery firms was in the Stockholm-Uppsala region.37\nFinally, and despite high quality R\u0026amp;D, Sweden faces challenges that may affect the cluster. These include the level of patenting, and small companies facing a choice between licensing products to ‘big pharma’ or being acquired. This has led to fears of stunted company growth, inhibiting the development of a thriving, home-grown sector.38\n(Photos from Unsplash: archway, train, buildings)\nNature October 2001, p.6 in Waluszewski, A., 2004.

The full report has eight case studies (see my previous piece on Pittsburgh). Individually, they tell the story of how the actions of leaders, businesses, universities and communities have affected the development of different places with different contexts and histories. Combined, patterns and trends begin to emerge. The story of Israel’s technology sector is closely intertwined with the complex history of Israel itself.\nIsrael, owing to its prolific track record of establishing innovative information and communications technology (ICT) companies, has earned itself the moniker of ‘start-up nation’. A 2011 book, taking this moniker as its title, described how Israel (with a population of just under nine million) had more companies on the Nasdaq stock exchange than South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India and all of Europe combined, and the highest density of start-ups per person in the world.1\nOthers describe Israel’s technology cluster as ‘Silicon Wadi’, after the concentration of high-tech firms along the coastal plain. Activity is concentrated in metropolitan Tel Aviv – including the affluent suburbs of Herzeliya, Ramat Gan and Ra’anana – and Haifa in the north (home to Matam Technology Park, Israel’s first and largest high-tech business park), together with the second city of Jerusalem. Including some secondary areas, such as the corridor south from Tel Aviv to Be’er Sheva and the Western Galilee, the cluster covers an area no larger than 6,000 square kilometres – half that of the extended Silicon Valley in the US.2\nAround 1,400 start-ups are created every year in Israel and some 800 shut down.3 In total, there is roughly one start up per 1,400 people. In comparison, France has 0.112 startups for every 1,400 people, Germany has 0.056, and the UK has 0.21.4 This growth is not just a recent phenomenon. According to the IVC Research Center, 10,866 high-tech companies were established in the period 2010 to 2019, with 98 listed on the Nasdaq, and 369 accelerators and 24 incubators established. Since 2010, capital raising by Israeli tech companies has risen by 400 percent and the number of deals by 64 percent.5\nAmid this explosion of numbers, questions have been asked whether Israel needs to transform from start-up nation to scale-up nation, or if too many young enterprises are being bought out by international companies.6 Others suggest the start-up scene has already matured: Israel’s cluster of high-technology industries emerged in the late 1990s. Since then many companies have grown substantially, and the country hosts large research and development (R\u0026amp;D) sites for many multinational technology companies.\nThese developments, and the orientation of the Israeli economy, are reflected in statistics for both exports and research and development. ICT services form over 45 percent of Israel’s service exports, compared to 7 percent for the UK, and 9.5 percent for high-income countries as a whole.7 Israel’s research and development expenditure, at 4.58 percent of GDP, towers above the UK (1.67 percent), and the high-income country average (2.57 percent).8 And Israel has 8,250 R\u0026amp;D researchers per million people, compared to 4,377 in the UK and 4,196 in high-income countries.9\nThe story of Israel’s technology sector is – more so than many other clusters – also a tale of the country’s national development. The emergence of the Israeli ICT cluster is the result of several complex and interrelated factors including culture, geopolitics, state intervention and broader government policies. Some of these factors, as we will see, can be double-edged swords, and few are easy to replicate (despite the Israeli model being cited as inspiration in other countries).10\nDevelopment # The emergence of Israel’s technology cluster can best be explained through direct factors – historical decisions shaped through geopolitical circumstances and government interventions – and contributory or enabling factors that include broader government policies, cultural influences and the military.\nIn an article on ‘Clusters as Innovation Engines’ published in the European Management Review, the authors claim that some of the world’s most powerful innovation clusters, including Tel Aviv, are relatively young and their origins cannot be traced to historical reasons as implied by cluster theory.11 This isn’t quite accurate: whilst the emergence of an Israeli technology cluster took place in a concentrated period of a few decades, the roots of this cluster can be traced to Israel’s founding in 1948.\nTwo constraints since then have encouraged innovation. First, Israel is resource-poor. According to Shimon Peres, former Israeli President and Prime Minister, ‘high-tech in Israel began with agriculture… technology was 95 percent of the secret of Israel’s prodigious agricultural productivity’.12 Today, the legacy of agricultural kibbutz (collective community) movements is felt in a proclivity for shared working and teamwork, and the converting of municipal facilities such as city libraries into incubator start-up spaces.13 And Israel’s national emphasis on agriculture and agricultural technology helped the transition into what is today a healthy biotechnology and life sciences cluster.14\nA second constraint is the geopolitics of the region. Even when Israel has not been at war with its neighbours, the relationship has been uneasy and borders closed to people and goods. This has meant a focus on innovative solutions and high-tech development as a form of protection, and a need to think globally and develop exports for more distant markets; software and services are easier to sell half way around the world than heavy machinery. Israel was then well-positioned to benefit from the global shift towards knowledge- and innovation-based economies.15\nThe Israel Defence Forces, given a central national role as a direct result of these geopolitical constraints, was a driving force of Israel’s emergence as a technology cluster. Military innovation accelerated following the French embargo imposed on Israel after the 1967 Middle East war, requiring Israel to develop its own military technology.16 Many commercial technologies have emerged from highly-specialised Israeli military R\u0026amp;D, from fibre-optics and voice compression to networking software and devices; Israeli military intelligence had a computer training unit as early at 1960 helping establish world-leading expertise that was later commercialised.17 As important as the technology itself, however, was flow of people with the skills and leadership ability to manage technology companies, and deep experience of working on cutting-edge innovations.18\nIsraeli high-tech firms began to form in the 1960s, albeit at a slow pace.19 ECI Telecom was founded in 1961, and Tadiran and Elron Electronics in 1962; Elron is seen as the ‘Fairchild of Israel’ after the legendary Silicon Valley firm. Yet the cluster truly emerged in the mid-1990s, as the rate of successful companies grew from 1-2 per year to 10-20. de Fontenay and Carmel attribute this to the emergence of ‘specialised cluster intermediary services’ such as venture capital and legal services, services which also had professional networks in the United States, the major market for Israeli companies. Strong interpersonal networks and direct experience then allowed new firms to grow more quickly.20\nBroader developments helped the cluster’s growth. Global telecommunications and internet booms in the 1990s increased demand and led to several high-profile acquisitions of Israeli companies.21 Shifts in the computer industry from hardware to software products greatly benefited Israel, particularly owing to the demand from businesses for security tools – several of which had been well-tested within Israeli military communications networks.22 Finally, the 1993 Oslo accords with the Palestinians encourages large companies such as Cisco, Motorola, IBM, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard to invest heavily in R\u0026amp;D centres in Israel, helping to build international networks, expand employment opportunities and develop skills.23\nGovernment interventions have directly stimulated the Israeli technology cluster, with the state nurturing the development of a venture capital industry. Several initiatives stand out. Yozma (Hebrew for ‘initiative’) began in 1993 with 100 million USD and established 10 venture capital funds with the aim of attracting foreign direct investment into Israel. Investors were offered matched funding at the rate of two dollars from the government for every dollar committed by a foreign investor. Equally generous was the option of buying out the government’s stake in the fund after five years. The fund has grown to manage billions of dollars of capital today.24\nOther important initiatives include the Office of the Chief Scientist (now Israel Innovation Authority) R\u0026amp;D Development Fund, which gives new R\u0026amp;D facilities access to interest-free loans to match private investment, and the Israel-US Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation (BIRD) fund, financed by both governments. BIRD ‘played matchmaker’ between an Israeli company with innovative technology and a US company who could distribute and market the product. Although the financial incentives were helpful, the largest impact was to teach young Israeli companies how to do business in the US.25 The state has also reduced bureaucracy, simplified tax regulations, and established incubators.26\nFinally, two further factors have enabled cluster growth. The first is the influence of the unique Israeli military culture, pervasive in Israeli businesses because of compulsive military service (for at least two years from the age of 18). The Israel Defence Forces have an unusually flat hierarchy, leading to informal communication with superiors (and the willingness to challenge authority), great flexibility, the development of strong leadership skills, and experience of shouldering considerable responsibility at a young age: all skills that translate into strong entrepreneurship and teamwork in business.27 The strong networks formed in the military – often with people from different backgrounds – are then maintained through reserve duty for many years following military service.28 Alumni who met whilst working in the elite military units (particularly in intelligence) have spawned many high-tech companies, and graduates from these units are often the recruitment targets of major US technology companies.29\nThe second contributory factor was a large stock of human capital. Levels of education and technical skills are high, supported by world-class universities such as the Israel Institute of Technology (called the Technion) and the Weizmann Institute of Science. But the Israeli government’s open immigration policy towards Jews has also provided a significant inflow of talent. When the US tightened immigration in the 1990s, Israel saw a dramatic increase in immigration of often highly-educated Jewish immigrants from former Soviet Union nations – in ten years the population grew by 800,000, or one fifth; the number of engineers in Tel Aviv doubled. Given the traditional strengths of Soviet Union countries in theoretical sciences, Israel became ‘a superpower in mathematics’, as well as gaining knowledge of proprietary technologies and different methodologies.30 These enabling factors helped provide fuel for the Israeli technology cluster, and in turn for the growth of the nation.\nOutcomes # By the late 1990s, the Israeli technology cluster was internationally connected and strongly entrepreneurial, based on deep stocks of human capital and local knowledge. The source of this innovation was commercialisation of military technology and university R\u0026amp;D, supported by flows of skilled workers and a government interventions to promote investment and generate capital.31 Although the acquisitions of several Israeli companies and the opening of large R\u0026amp;D plants put the country on the global innovation radar, it was the result of decades of government-led economic development rooted in efforts to secure national security and high-tech growth.\nThere are several key outcomes of these developments. First, Israel’s technology cluster overcame its geographic isolation to work effectively with distant – primarily US – markets by building on world-leading expertise and targeting business customers who require less face-to-face support.32 Professional ties with other clusters, such as Silicon Valley, are strong and aided by the diaspora concentrated in New York and Los Angeles. Concerns over brain drain, as young Israelis look to study and work abroad, are countered by new networks formed and the return of expatriates – often many years later – to set up regional offices or to champion investment and R\u0026amp;D centres in Israel.33\nSecond, a mature venture capital industry has emerged in Israel. More than 430 professional investors (including venture capital firms, private equity firms and incubators) have a permanent presence in Israel; just under a quarter of these are non-Israeli. Nearly 1,500 investors, representing more than 30 countries, invested in Israeli companies during 2018.34\nThird, the Israeli culture – a somewhat intangible factor that draws on the collectivist origins of Israeli society and the nature of the military – has offered a competitive advantage. In addition to the factors explored in the section above, it has been suggested that collectivism and military service translates into loyalty, strong teamwork and lower turnover in the workplace compared to competitor nations. This might mean, for example, faster development times and greater retained knowledge when designing new computer chips – which often have long development cycles.35 However, despite these considerable advantages, the Israeli technology cluster faces several challenges that spring from each of these three outcomes.\nLooking forward # One might imagine that the spectre of instability and violence, which served as the impetus for Israel’s focus on national growth and security, might also undo confidence in the ability of Israelis to innovate, and undermine investment in Israeli companies. Senor and Singer argue in Start-Up Nation that the determination of Israeli entrepreneurs to continue innovating in the face of war makes the country more enticing for investors.36 An analysis of the effect of Palestinian terrorist attacks during the second Intifada (2000-2005) found that despite being profoundly affected by terrorism, Israeli society was not demoralised by it because the public possessed a high level of social resilience – fostered in part by the cohesiveness of Israeli-Jewish society.37 Although violence continues to be a risk factor, more prosaic factors are perhaps of more concern.\nFirst, the cultural attributes that lend themselves to entrepreneurialism may be a double-edged sword. The Israeli high-tech community has been accused of inattention to detail, indifference to quality, an unscalable management culture, and poor customer service. In particular, the management culture may be hindering the growth of companies, with few growing larger than 1,000 employees.38 Others fear that the ‘national characteristic of brusqueness is better suited to the creative process, not the nurturing of long-term projects’.39\nSecond, there is concern that start-up founders are too focused on buy-outs (and big pay offs) from overseas companies or public listings, instead of growing large businesses.40 Connected to this are perennial fears of brain drain and an exodus of talent to the US.41 These fears are heightened by a shortage of skilled software engineers, with five jobs for every applicant in the sector. Efforts to bridge the gap include alternative training programs such as tech boot camps, and boosting recruitment of women and Arab and ultra-Orthodox Jewish minorities, who are all under-represented in the sector.42\n(Photos from Unsplash: street, square, skyline)\nSenor, D. and Singer, S., 2011.

If done effectively, international collaborations offer the opportunity to hit multiple policy priorities: levelling up regions, boosting investment in R\u0026amp;D towards 2.4 percent of GDP, and strengthening overseas relationships post-Brexit.\nCities and regions have a long history of forging overseas relationships directly with international partners. So-called ‘municipal internationalism’ thrived in the nineteenth century, culminating in the formation of the International Union of Local Authorities in 1913. Today, ambitious city regions across Europe have overseas offices (often in Brussels) and a complex web of relationships around the world. As Shane Ewen and Michael Hebbert put it, ‘the spirit of the Hanseatic League is alive and well in Europe\u0026rsquo;s town halls’.\nThere has been renewed interest in the topic in recent years. ‘Decentralised Development Cooperation’ is promoted by the likes of the OECD as means to help cities and regions achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. City diplomacy is an established academic field. I even published some musings of my own on the topic back in 2016.\nThe Nesta report is, however, valuable for considering how international collaborations can boost policy innovation (for leaders and governments), systems innovation (to address longer-term systemic issues of institutional capacity) and partnerships innovation (between government and business, universities, and other institutions) at the local level. The latter, in particular, is significant. Michele Acuto has observed that the average distance between a city hall and the closest major university is just under four kilometres in four of the major city networks. Strong, strategic partnerships at local level can only help strengthen international ones.\nOne effect of COVID-19 will be a greater role for universities and other civic bodies in regional collaborations. According to the report, ‘these are repeatedly viewed as critical and under-tapped intermediaries in peer-to-peer collaboration, because they have additional and more durable capacity as well as the ability to pedagogically transmit key principles, codify lessons and develop processes for distributed on-the-ground implementation’. Initiatives such as the EUniverCities network, in which medium-sized cities and their universities work together, offer a glimpse at what this may look like as a formalised structure.\nFor Yorkshire, the relationships that exist in the region between universities and LEPs, Combined Authorities, metro mayors, and local authorities provide a solid base to build upon. Both local government and the region’s universities have a wide set of relationships with counterparts around the world. The extent of city twinning in the region (which exploded in popularity after world war two) provide an insight into the range of partners: Hull is twinned with several cities, including Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Niigata, Japan. York and Bradford both have twins in France and Germany. Sheffield’s twins include Chengdu in China, Kawasaki, Japan and Pittsburgh, United States. Leeds is twinned with several cities including Hangzhou in China, Dortmund, Germany, and Durban, South Africa.\nThe multiple policy priorities of levelling up, boosting investment in R\u0026amp;D, and strengthening overseas relationships – ambitious even before COVID-19 struck – mean we need to bring universities into the centre of efforts to collaborate internationally on innovation. This would provide a timely boost to the concept of ‘Global Britain’.\n(Photo of Brussels from Unsplash)\n","date":"15 October 2020","permalink":"/posts/innovators-without-borders/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"This post originally appeared on the Yorkshire Universities website.","title":"Innovators Without Borders"},{"content":"","date":"14 October 2020","permalink":"/types/interview/","section":"Types","summary":"","title":"Interview"},{"content":"","date":"14 October 2020","permalink":"/places/singapore/","section":"Places","summary":"","title":"Singapore"},{"content":" Available here (Soundcloud).

The full report has eight case studies. Individually, they tell the story of how the actions of leaders, businesses, universities and communities have affected the development of different places with different contexts and histories. Combined, patterns and trends begin to emerge. The story of Pittsburgh is one of a slow recovery fuelled by investments with long-term returns, and a slow accumulation of talent and expertise.\nThe Pittsburgh cluster is perhaps best described as several clusters with some areas of overlap. The Pittsburgh Innovation District lists these as life sciences and digital health, advanced manufacturing, and AI and robotics, whereas the Brookings Institution identifies manufacturing, technology, and health care as key clusters.1 These industries have grown by 8.4 percent, nearly double Pittsburgh’s private-sector growth rate, since the end of the recession in the early 2010s.2\nBusinesses in these clusters work closely with the university sector. The University of Pittsburgh is recognised as a leader in life sciences research, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) is a top-ranked hospital system with 89,000 employees and 40 hospitals, and Carnegie Mellon University has specialist expertise in computer science and engineering.3 The metropolitan area outperforms the national average on academic activity, ranking ninth among the largest 100 cities for the amount of university research and development, and performs particularly strongly in fields such as robotics, gerontology, critical care, artificial intelligence, cell and tissue engineering, neurotrauma, and software.4\nThe Oakland district is the academic and healthcare centre of Pittsburgh, and is an example of two much-vaunted developments: an innovation district home to a dense, walkable hub of economic activity for research and entrepreneurship, and a shift from heavy industry to ‘eds and meds’, with the knowledge-rich ecosystem that accompanies universities, large hospitals and their spinoffs and spillovers.5 As the Brookings Institution has noted, few cities have such a naturally occurring innovation district as Pittsburgh: Oakland represents three percent of the city’s land area, ten percent of residents, 29 percent of jobs, and over a third of the state of Pennsylvania’s university research output.6 As such, challenges remain in ensuring inclusive growth in neighbouring districts (which have some of the highest rates of long-term unemployment and poverty in the city), connecting communities to new opportunities, and addressing regional inequalities.\nPittsburgh’s performance is often framed against the collapse of the steel industry in the city in the 1980s, when the unemployment rate in the city hit 18 percent. Prior to the collapse, manufacturing represented more than a quarter of all employment in Pittsburgh; today manufacturing accounts for under ten percent of employment. More people work in Pittsburgh’s health sector today than in the steel industry at its highest point.7 Although this transformation is remarkable, the seeds for Pittsburgh’s resurgence were planted long before the collapse of the steel industry in the city.\nDevelopment # By 1983, Pittsburgh – seen as the industrial powerhouse of the US – was in economic breakdown. The Pittsburgh Press newspaper described it as a tide of change: ‘town by town, factory by factory, job by job’.8 Three quarters of Pittsburgh’s steelmaking capacity and 130,000 manufacturing jobs were lost, and tens of thousands of residents moved away – with knock-on effects for the businesses and services which remained.9\nIn the following decades, the economy shifted from low- and moderate-value production to technology-driven services and high-value advanced manufacturing. This shift was led by a focus on innovation, driven by federally-funded research at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.10 But an overarching theme of Pittsburgh’s story is a slow recovery fuelled by investments with long-term returns, and a slow accumulation of talent and expertise. It is necessary to trace the roots of today’s research clusters to the height of the steel industry in Pittsburgh.11\nImportant (but some, at the time, seemingly modest) investments were made in three areas in the 1950s.12 The first was a partnership known as ‘Renaissance I’ between local government leaders and Pittsburgh’s business community (under the banner of the Allegheny Conference). The aim was to improve the quality of life in the city and address the region’s environmental and infrastructure issues. Real estate development was channelled through public authorities, deserted train sheds were converted to house and offices, cultural attractions were built, and transport and sanitation improved.\nThe second investment was a donation of $50 million from the local Mellon family to the University of Pittsburgh to build and run a new medical school. The creation of a world-class medical research institution set a foundation for the region’s biomedical research strengths today. The third set of investments follows from this: that of the philanthropic community who grew wealthy from Pittsburgh’s industry. Funding from philanthropic foundations has ensured the survival of much of the city’s cultural infrastructure from the Symphony Orchestra to community arts organisations – an essential ingredient in creating an environment for attracting and retaining skilled workers. More recently, foundations in the city have tended to view economic development through technological innovation as a core part of their social mission. Philanthropic investment has, for example, helped transfer robotic and automation technology from the lab to the city for real-world testing, and was central to starting programmes of work on machine learning, computational finance, and robotics at Carnegie Mellon University.13 The close relationship between philanthropy and universities has a long history in Pittsburgh, and is central to shaping the city’s development.\nThese investments bore fruit years after the collapse of Pittsburgh’s steel industry. They are not, however, responsible alone for the creation of Pittsburgh’s research clusters. Upon this foundation, the local universities and local government (and, in particular, their leaders) played a key role, supported by federal and state grants.\nAs unemployment soared, the heads of Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh – historically competitors – decided to coordinate efforts to diversify Pittsburgh’s economy and drive research and development in the city.14 In 1978 Carnegie Mellon University, led by Richard Cyert, established the Robotics Institute with corporate funding, and planted the seed for the city’s expertise in this area (the CMU Robotics Institute also became the first in the world to offer a PhD in robotics).15 Heaton et al describe the investments made by university and local leaders in new technologies in Pittsburgh – others included biotech and computing – as ‘sensing activities’. These are ‘long-gestation investments’ that are the first stage of a new innovation ecosystem (with no guarantee they will pay off), and which ‘assess internal and external signals about scientific and technological developments that hold promise for the future, then ensure that sufficient financial and faculty resources are available for exploring the most attractive possibilities’.16\nIn 1986, with University of Pittsburgh Chancellor Wesley Posvar’s guidance, all of the city’s hospitals, teaching hospitals and research facilities were brought together under one not-for-profit roof – known today as UPMC. And as Carnegie Mellon University sought out the best researchers to relocate in Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh persuaded medical experts to join, including pioneers of organ transplantation – helping to establish the city as a world-leading centre in this area.17\nThe universities have continued to play an important role in shaping Pittsburgh’s research and innovation clusters. When Jared Cohon stepped down as Carnegie Mellon University president in 2013, he identified three key ways the institution helped Pittsburgh’s economic shift: by making it easier for professors to start new companies by changing the technology transfer policy, by collaborating with the University of Pittsburgh to support start-ups, and by building the Robert Mehrabian Collaborative Innovation Centre.18 This centre opened in 2005 and was funded by state, university and private money, allowing companies and researchers to work collaboratively.\nState and federal governments have also played an important role. Both provided grants to research universities and seed funding to entrepreneurs in technology-related fields. As Holstein and Eschenfelder conclude, state-funded accelerator programmes:\nreduced information asymmetry and externality problems that inhibit the birth of new enterprises. Their highly selective application process reduced cost to angel investors and venture capital firms of searching for early-stage startups with high commercial potential. The rigorous and short-term duration of these programs accelerated growth of some startups, but also accelerated failure of others enabling resources to move to higher valued uses. These programs also linked potential tech entrepreneurs to a network of mentors who provide the legal, accounting, marketing, and management skills that they lack. As a critical mass of successful tech ventures were established, new accelerator programs began to obtain funding from private sources and the inflow of capital from angel investors and venture capital firms from various parts of the country increased.19\nPittsburgh’s reinvention required the city’s leadership to ‘think like a system and act like an entrepreneur’ – taking stock of assets, cultivating talent, and maintaining a good place to live, whilst taking risks, seizing opportunities and being flexible.20 Tom Murphy, a state representative who later became mayor of Pittsburgh, is regarded as one such leader. Recognising and supporting the role of universities in a post-steel Pittsburgh, he introduced the Ben Franklin Technology Partnership in 1983, dedicated to advancing early-stage startup businesses and the commercialisation of technologies – since described as a state programme run like a venture capital firm.21\nAfter becoming mayor in 1994, Murphy developed more than 25 miles of new trails alongside the river and urban green space, and cleaned up more than 1,000 acres of abandoned industrial land.22 In more recent years, the city has improved its food and art culture, helping to attract skilled workers.23 This, combined with a consistently low cost of living, has helped Pittsburgh’s economic transition.24 Above all, however, this transition has been driven by the long-standing alliance between universities, local leaders, businesses and the civic community – and the return on investments made long ago.\nOutcomes # Michael J. Madison, a Professor at the University of Pittsburgh, describes the city’s revitalisation as being less about the ‘grit’ and character of Pittsburghers (a popular narrative to explain the transition) and more about having economic diversification thrust upon it.25 But by building on strong research and innovation assets – UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh, and Carnegie Mellon University – the city has managed to excel in knowledge production. Pittsburgh’s education and technology sectors account for 80 percent of the high-wage jobs in the city.26 Overall, the technology sector accounts for a third of annual payroll in the Pittsburgh region, helping to retain highly educated young people.27 And in 2016 the region’s university research and development spending per capita was nearly two and a half times the national average.28\nThere are still threads connecting modern Pittsburgh to the rich legacy of manufacturing in the city. The advanced manufacturing clusters in the region are highly specialised: automation and industrial machinery, and metals and metal processing each have more than two times the national employment concentration. New clusters have formed around these industries as technology companies seek access to top engineering and computer science talent.29\nHowever, the acceleration of scientific and technical activity and global expertise headquartered in the city has not translated locally into broad-based growth outside the clusters, and in the neighbourhoods in which they are sited.30 As Madison puts it, ‘steel money was sucked out of one part of the Pittsburgh region; new money is largely being injected elsewhere’.31 The risk is that, without new jobs being created at all skill levels, spatial inequality in the region will increase. The Brookings Institution recommends in particular that the Oakland innovation district needs to be marketed and better connected to the regional economy, with better integration with nearby employment centres.32\nPittsburgh’s history and resurgence has been much studied and analysed. Professor Michael Porter, considered the father of cluster theory, draws several lessons from Pittsburgh for other cities.33 First – and as we have seen – cluster growth is a long-term process with assets taking decades to develop. Second, diversification across several clusters helps strengthen the regional economy and to protect it against economic shocks. Third, research and development investment is critical, but so too is effective commercialisation mechanisms – and Pittsburgh faces challenges in this area (see below). Finally, strong and unified leadership is required to push for a regional cluster development programme.\nLooking forward # A 2017 benchmarking report examined the prospects of Pittsburgh’s life sciences cluster, and found great opportunities for developing new solutions and innovations at the intersection with other clusters – automation, robotics, and healthcare – and with other areas of expertise – biomedicine at the University of Pittsburgh and computer science at Carnegie Mellon University.34 The blurring and crossover of disciplinary boundaries extends to collaboration with the private sector. The report gives the example of UPMC partnering with IBM Watson to form Pensiamo, a Pittsburgh-based startup using cognitive analytics to improve supply chain performance in hospitals.35\nPittsburgh’s clusters face several challenges. Commercialisation is lagging, in particular in life science firms, which often take longer to develop. Although investment trends are improving, the region has less venture capital funding than other US innovation hubs.36 Connected to this is a low rate of high-growth startups. One contributing factor is the need for more corporate partners (a barrier to recruiting talent to startups is the lack of backup employment options if the local startup does not succeed – a truly effective cluster, by definition, offers choice).37 And finally, ongoing challenges remain over continuing to build links between the research being conducted in universities and the strengths of industry, and ensuring a pipeline of skills to meet future workforce needs: fundamental concerns that remain constant even for well-established clusters.38\n(Photos from Unsplash: bridge, skyline, freeways)\nhttps://www.pittsburgh-id.com/innovation-clusters; Andes, S., Horowitz, M., Helwig, R. and Katz, B., (2017).

For a more detailed look at some of the topics explored here, see our February 2021 academic paper_ 📃\nI enjoyed speaking on a lively panel yesterday about regional development and innovation as part of the UIIN conference, relocated successfully from Budapest to Zoom. Together with Matthew Guest from GuildHE we discussed how to better understand the local role of small and specialist providers.\nThe work builds on experimental alternatives to traditional economic impact studies. I first explored the idea of institutional heatmaps on a post here in 2018, and then expanded on this at a workshop in South Africa later that year. Over the past 12 months I have been working with GuildHE to ‘map’ the impact of some of their members. In yesterday’s presentation I set out why I think the traditional ‘big number’ approach to measuring economic impact is out of step with what places need from their universities. Below I go further and list why I feel these studies are, mostly, flawed endeavours. (I should add that these are my personal views, not those of GuildHE!).\nYou don’t have to look far to see economic impact studies. My former employer had a flagship biennial report with a steadily-increasing figure for the impact of UK universities – £21.5 billion to UK gross domestic product at last count – which it has used successfully for lobbying and campaigning. As long as this figure keeps increasing, everybody is happy. Many institutions have their own studies – £650 million of impact here, £400 million impact there – and often with LEP-level or regional disaggregation. Of course, such studies are not limited to higher education. We’re informed that shooting contributes £2 billion to the UK economy and supports the equivalent of 74,000 full-time jobs. Ornamental horticulture and landscaping contributed £24.2 billion to national GDP in 2017.\nWhy we need change # There are helpful academic papers which deconstruct the methodologies for calculating economic impact, and the common pitfalls. Instead, I want to challenge the preoccupation we seem to have with ‘one big number’ impact studies and what we lose in the process.\nThere are two shifts taking place which render the traditional impact study less effective:\nA single large number fails to capture what is increasingly important. The shift towards universities being ‘for’ a place, rather than simply ‘in’ or ‘from’ a place, means this data needs to be far more nuanced. We need to know specifically who is benefitting, and how, and who is missed out. We need to know the businesses and the communities behind these numbers. As disillusionment grows with traditional methods of measuring economic success – GDP, GVA – and attention on ‘inclusive’ and social development begins to be translated into policy change, economic impact analysis needs to keep up.\nTraditional impact studies simply don\u0026rsquo;t do justice to the range of university activities. They measure spending, output and employment, but do not capture the full impact of engaging with communities in a marginalised neighbourhood, or working with small businesses to strengthen their supply chains, for example – activities that may have huge impact but make little difference to a £400 million impact figure. (Accounting for social value can help here).\nAs we grapple with recovery from Covid-19, it is both tone-deaf and ineffective for universities to be shouting about how good they are, whilst also asking for assistance from government. Rather than communicating about the size of their value-added, university messaging needs to focus on solutions and partnerships. Policymakers need a more sophisticated understanding of impact which moves beyond broad figures to specific information on which communities, businesses and industries have benefited from the university, and who stands to benefit from future support.\nWhat else is wrong with traditional impact studies? # I should note that economic impact studies are not all bad. It is helpful to see returns on investment, and to raise awareness that universities have economic clout and should be seen alongside other major industries. But they risk being a blunt instrument, obscuring what is often highly patchy and inconsistent local impact behind impressively large numbers. Economic impact studies need to be married to a rich understanding of local impact – perhaps through something like an institutional heat map combined with a survey of perceptions or social impact assessments.\nFour further shortcomings that come to mind:\nUniformity. Despite huge variation in local contexts across the UK, and the individual histories and missions of universities, impact studies all end up looking pretty much the same. As with my engagement strategies test, if you line up five university impact studies and remove the university name, can you tell who (or where) they are talking about? The uniformity of approach, and measuring success against numerical benchmarks, means we lose out on what may be needed. By working towards what is measured and counted, impact ends up converging into a standardised set of headline numbers and we lose the local context. Impact. Slightly tongue-in-cheek, I would like to see an impact study of impact studies. Do they lead to positive change? Or boost perceptions of universities? Quite possibly. But next time you are in a taxi to a university, ask the driver about the impact of the university. You’re unlikely to be quoted an economic impact figure of £450 million a year to the LEP’s economy. You’ll probably be told about the business that decided to open a new site near the university, or the impact of students volunteering with communities (and how the university is good business for the taxi company – at least before lockdown). You might argue that economic impact analysis is aimed instead at funders and policymakers. But should it not also reach residents and businesses? Fatigue. Somewhat cynically, does anyone really care whether the economic impact is £600 or £900 million? Beyond a certain point, big number fatigue sets in. Figures between institutions are not always directly comparable, and the process of reaching the figures is not always transparent (or easily replicable). Unintended consequences. We are not at this point, but I can imagine a league table of economic impact rankings. Universities should be well aware of the limitations of league tables, and the uncanny ability of rankings to shape and warp policies away from what is important – both for the institution and for the place. Above all, my concern is that economic impact analysis can mask inequalities and ‘cold spots’ in university engagement. Of course, heatmapping as an experimental alternative brings its own set of issues. Consistency between institutions, subjective judgements over the importance and intensity of shading, and the complexity of trying to map such a wide range of activity are issues that need to be resolved. But they may also expose quite starkly where a university is not working, and not having an impact – things that are hidden in the ‘one big number’ approach.\n(Image credits: original images from Unsplash here and here.)\n","date":"10 June 2020","permalink":"/posts/university-impact-studies-are-flawed/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"A version of this article also appears in ACEEU Spotlight magazine 📖_.","title":"Why most university impact studies are flawed"},{"content":"Yesterday Nesta published a report arguing that some parts of the UK have missed out on £4 billion of public research and development (R\u0026amp;D) funding each year, plus a further £8 billion of private sector investment. Some of these regions never fully recovered from the 2008 Great Recession, and COVID-19 threatens to deepen these divisions.\nThe Government’s target – set before the pandemic – called for the UK to increase investment in R\u0026amp;D to 2.4% of GDP by 2027, and by 3% in the future. The importance of this target is now greater than before. To meet it means empowering those regions with the lowest R\u0026amp;D intensity and recognising and supporting the vital role of universities and other partners in these regions.\nProposals in the report include devolving a substantial portion (25%) of the promised uplift in the R\u0026amp;D budget to nations, cities and regions, delivered through ‘Innovation Deals’.\nThe report also recognises how historic policy decisions have led to path dependency for regions, entrenching a set of ‘winners’ and ‘losers’. (This factor is missing in some – otherwise reasonable – recent reports which instead advocate building on existing centres of excellence). As the Nesta authors put it:\nThe current situation is the result of a combination of deliberate policy decisions and a natural dynamic in which these small preferences combined with initial advantages are reinforced with time.\nIndustrial capacity # Decisions made by previous generations of policymakers and politicians also play an outsized role in the UK’s industrial policy.\nThis excellent piece on efficiency and redundancy in the UK, and how we need more of the latter at the expense of the former to ensure resilience, is taken forwards nicely by Andy Westwood in this discussion of building industrial capacity in the UK. Building in redundant capacity is seen as a signature trait of a ‘resilient’ city or region. Andy sets out the case for starting with ‘national self sufficiency’ in health and manufacturing but then rapidly broadening out to other sectors, with a focus on impact at the local level. Movement towards autarky is a balancing act needing careful trade-offs, but there is a strong case for securing – or at least diversifying – supply chains in key industries and sectors.\nThe pandemic has drastically curtailed trade and investment; a return to previous patterns of international cooperation (which differ across UK regions) following COVID-19, and when trade picks up, is unlikely. More emphasis will be given to secure and resilient supply chains within the UK and near neighbours. This means strengthening industrial capacity and domestic manufacturing in the UK, and ensuring the provision of critical goods and services across the country – with clear implications for spatially-aware policymaking and an opportunity for rebuilding local economies.\nThese discussions neatly fit with a few themes I have touched on in recent posts – on how discussions over the smart city have morphed into ones about self-sufficient cities, on the risks of poor policymaking for resilience, and why popular narratives around ‘resilient communities’ are dangerous.

The book received wide praise when published in 2017, telling the story of a community trying to pick itself up in the years following the closure of a major General Motors assembly plant. But the story has particular resonance now, as we stand on the cusp of another wave of economic upheaval. Here are three reflections.\nA tale of two towns # Five years after the General Motors plant closed, the shock of vanished jobs has faded. But ‘the ways that time and economic misfortune can rend even a resilient community – a community determined not to lie down and give up – are plain to see’. Goldstein describes the emergence of two Janesvilles: one of business owners that emerged relatively unscathed, and another large group of struggling families. For this group, part of a ‘broad tumbling downhill’, the future is uncertain, incomes have halved, mortgages outstrip house values, food stamps have replaced eating out, and health insurance stops.\nInequality is at the heart of recent work by Yorkshire Universities on health and wealth, including a forthcoming report with NHS Confederation and the Yorkshire \u0026amp; Humber Academic Health Science Network (AHSN). Just before the pandemic struck, Sir Michael Marmot published a report showing widening regional disparities in life expectancy, including falling life expectancy for the poorest. In Yorkshire and the Humber, healthy life expectancy at birth is lower than the national average – with stark variations within the region too. Absence from work because of sickness is greater than the national average. Mortality rates are uniformly higher.\nThe danger is that the long-term economic impact of coronavirus exacerbates these inequalities. A briefing paper from the Institute for Fiscal Studies makes uncomfortable reading, referencing a study that showed a 1% fall in employment leads to a 2% increase in the prevalence of chronic illness:\nTo put this in context, if employment were to fall by the same amount as it fell in the 12 months after the 2008 crisis, around 900,000 more people of working age would be predicted to suffer from a chronic health condition. Only about half this effect will be immediate: the full effect will not be felt for two years. The shock to employment from the coronavirus pandemic is likely to be much larger than this and so we may expect a larger rise in poor health.\nThe poorest in society are hit hardest by recessions, driving wider inequalities in health and wealth, and splitting towns and cities into two.\nThe challenges of retraining # ‘It isn’t simple to take someone with a high school degree and a factory job and help lead them into new work’, reflects Bob Borremans. Bob is a community leader and head of Janesville’s job centre, and faces an uphill battle despite enthusiastic trainees and injections of federal cash.\nRetraining and re-skilling are obvious responses to job losses and economic restructuring. But promised jobs at the end of retraining do not always materialise, and the path to graduation is tough. In Janesville, many former factory workers turned to courses at Blackhawk Technical College funded by federal grant programmes. Despite the laudable work of the college, the average pay of those who graduate is a shadow of their pre-recession wages.\nThe UK’s What Works Centre for Local Economic Growth concludes that employment training programmes for adults can have a positive, although modest, impact on earnings and employment. The key to success is designing appropriate programmes. A review of the evidence by the Centre found shorter programmes (below six months) are more effective for less formal training activity, and that longer programmes generate employment gains when the content is skill-intensive. On the job training programmes tend to outperform classroom-based ones. Further and higher education providers should bear this in mind in the months and years to come.\nPhoenixes vs. Planting Seeds # Janesville is proud of its ‘can-do spirit’, a trait that can be traced back generation to generation, to the industrious and hard-working communities that first attracted the likes of General Motors to the town. The problem is that a can-do spirit is, by itself, rarely enough to save a town struck by economic upheaval.\nIn another project, I have been exploring how world-leading research clusters have emerged in certain places – from advanced manufacturing in Pittsburgh, to life sciences in the Stockholm-Uppsala region, to the high-tech industry in Israel. Many of these have a popular ‘origin story’, often spun by an enthusiastic local press. The story usually goes something like this. The town has a proud past rooted in a particular industry. Economic calamity strikes due to wider structural forces. The proud industry is obliterated. There’s mass unemployment, and, temporarily, hope is lost. But the community is resilient and bounces back through sheer determination and hard work, attracting a new industry and forging a new, bright future – a high-tech phoenix rising from industrial ashes.\nThe reality is often messier, and the roots of any revival go back much further than the economic calamity. Take Pittsburgh. The steel industry in the city collapsed in the 1980s and the unemployment rate hit 18 percent. The city’s revitalisation is often explained by the grit and character of Pittsburghers, whereas the seeds of revival were planted decades before when the steel industry was at its height. Philanthropic investment led to specialist expertise being developed at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University, including a new medical school, forming the foundation of Pittsburgh’s research and innovation clusters today.\nThere is a similar story in Sweden. When Pharmacia, then one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in Europe, merged with the US company Upjohn in 1995, around 200 research and managerial positions were moved out of Uppsala; the move was initially seen as striking a huge blow to the region. The popular narrative is that the vacuum left by the company’s withdrawal led to a frenzy of entrepreneurial start-ups and innovative ideas. But the emergence of the Uppsala cluster is the result of industrial and academic collaboration over at least 70 years.\nThe message here is not that people and communities are not important. Specialisation builds on rich legacies, and new clusters form around old industries. Some people – especially the highly-skilled – will thrive; employment in automation and industrial machinery in Pittsburgh is more than twice the national average. But people need to be empowered by structures and institutions that support them. Some places are fortunate to have seeds planted long ago, such as a strong university. Despite the challenges such institutions will be facing themselves, they will need to step up. For places those without, relying on grit will not be enough.\n(Photo by Science in HD on Unsplash)\n","date":"4 May 2020","permalink":"/posts/when-economy-collapses-cant-rely-on-grit/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"This post originally appeared on the Yorkshire Universities website.","title":"When a local economy collapses, we can’t just rely on the grit of communities"},{"content":"What follows is a simplified version of this workflow. It’s great for rapid literature surveys, and I’ve done a few recently for non-academic projects. No reference managers or specialist software are required. I use Ulysses for Mac to do my writing in the workflow below, but any text editor on any platform will do.\n1. Gather everything in one place # Save all the documents you will be reviewing in a folder. Optionally, split by type: in the example images below I have a folder for academic articles, and another for assorted reports, website pages and other publicity material.\nAcademic source documents\nNumber these sequentially, as in the images. As you work through them, you may wish to label them as read (I’ve used a green tag to remember which ones I have reviewed).\nNon-academic source documents\n(Skip to the bottom if you’re a Mac user and want to know how to find articles on Google Scholar incredibly quickly).\n2. Create loose headers or categories (optional) # If it will save sorting time later, create headers in a text document corresponding to the final output. For example, in my latest project this was simply ‘introduction’, ‘development’, ‘outcomes’, ‘future’.\n3. Scan the documents # As you read each document, copy and paste the key information into your text file. The less you copy, the easier the final review becomes. Before each extract, put the document number or letter from step 1. Add comments if helpful.\nPasting extracts from source documents. \u0026lsquo;F\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;6\u0026rsquo; refer to difference sources\nUlysses offers advantages for taking notes: you can quickly navigate between headers using keyboard shortcuts, and you can easily distinguish comments from pasted text. But other programs will work fine.\n4. Sort into sub-categories (optional) # In this example, after working through 19 documents I had over 7,000 words of notes, which was a little unwieldy. To speed things up later, I had identified themes and quickly moved text around within new sub-categories (two or three within each of the four main headers). This should be a quick and crude exercise; don’t worry about missing things as the next stage will capture these.\nAdding sub-categories. This should be a quick and crude process\n5. Duplicate, write and delete # Create a copy of your notes. Name it something like ‘DELETABLE’ so you don’t mix it up with your main notes.\nYou now begin writing. As you draw from your notes, cite the source with the number of the document, preceded by any unique character (in the image below, the footnote would contain the text “@3” to indicate source document number 3, for example, with the page number included if needed). The reason for the unique character will become clear in the next step.\nWriting the final output\nWhen you’ve included content from your notes, delete it from the copy. If you decide you no longer want or need to use an extract, delete it. As you proceed, the copy of your notes will get shorter and shorter.\nIn Ulysses, I have a second editor open with the deletable notes on the left, and the final output being written on the right.\n6. Tidy up references # When you’ve finished writing, do a find and replace on each source reference (e.g. “@3”) with the full reference. Saving this until the end means you aren’t distracted with referencing when you should be writing.

Publications are shifting their entire focus onto the pandemic (‘there is only one story in the world right now’, says WIRED magazine). There has been an explosion of academic publications on the virus, with peer review processes struggling to keep up.\nIn parallel, we’ve been looking through previous writing to find clues on how to deal with the crisis, and whether the warning signs were there. In 2015, Bill Gates explained how we are not ready for a future epidemic. In 2007, scientists in Hong Kong wrote a scarily prescient paper on coronaviruses, describing with great accuracy the ‘time bomb’ that went off in late 2019 in Wuhan, China.\nOne idea I’m revisiting is resilience. There are two sides to the concept. The first is empowering: a resilient place returns to normal as quickly as possible after a shock or a disturbance. Such places are flexible and adaptable, learn from previous crises, prioritise skills training, have inclusive societies, encourage innovation, develop diverse industries, and promote clear and transparent leadership. Although the terminology differs, policies around devolution and decentralisation to cities and regions have many of the same aims.\nThe other side is less rosy. As the concept gained traction in the early 2010s, cities in particular came under pressure to demonstrate their resilience. Leaders shouldered growing responsibilities for their city to tick the latest urban and regional policy boxes – to be sustainable, smart and resilient. However, as Lawrence Vale has written, ‘uneven resilience threatens the ability of cities as a whole to function economically, socially and politically’. Boosting resilience at a local level requires substantial resources and reliable support over long periods of time. Programmes to encourage resilience around the world have proven to be less than resilient themselves.\nShifting the power to tackle local issues and to respond to wider challenges from nations to regions is welcome. But if only responsibility is transferred, without accompanying resources where local institutional capacity and capability is limited, it is unlikely resilience – or devolution – will be successful. As we gradually turn to the economic recovery in the coming months, as government policies to ‘level up’ the regions return to the agenda, and as we consider how to prepare for future crises, it is worth revisiting the literature on resilience.\nPhoto by Alex Kim on Unsplash\n","date":"6 April 2020","permalink":"/posts/revisiting-resilience/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"This post originally appeared on the Yorkshire Universities website.","title":"Revisiting resilience"},{"content":"There’s plenty being written at the moment about staying sane whilst working from home, adapting to the change of lifestyle, and maintaining effective communication with distant colleagues. But here are four tools that have helped me to actually get good work done whilst I work from home (which I did two or three days per week until October 2018, and have done full-time since). Most of these are equally applicable in an office, but can seriously improve your output at home.\n1. The right music # Carefully chosen music can encourage deep focus and boost productivity. The best tool I’ve found for this is Brain.fm. The service boasts of ‘Functional Music to Improve Focus in 15 Minutes’. Regardless of whether the science behind the music stacks up, I find it invaluable for tasks requiring concentration (most of my PhD so far has been written to the ‘Cinematic Music Focus’ station). This link provides a free trial.\nA free alternative (but be wary of adverts interrupting your flow) is computer game soundtracks on YouTube – or playlists of such music on Spotify or other music services. These are designed to engage you in the task at hand and for background distractions to fade away. This YouTube channel is a good place to start.\n2. Laptop stand # A very basic recommendation, but an essential one. I use an AmazonBasics laptop stand that cost a little over £10. It will save your back and neck. Requires separate keyboard and mouse, which are also worthwhile investments.\n3. Distraction blocker # Stop yourself from mindlessly browsing the news or social media with a distraction blocker. I use Freedom which can block websites and applications – useful to shut off email for set periods of time or on a schedule. The very act of turning it on helps me to get into work mode, and once running it enables me to work more deeply on tasks for longer. There are several open source alternatives that I’ve used in the past, but Freedom offers more control and customisation.\n4. Pomodoro timer # Depending on the task, the pomodoro technique provides great results. You’ll need to experiment, but I find tedious tasks or reading articles and reports are perfect. Seriously applying the pomodoro technique also allows you to track and increase your focused work time.\nI use an open source application called Tomighty. There are more advanced options for Mac discussed here.\nOpportunities # Working from home offers an opportunity to experiment with new routines, workflows, habits, tools and ways of working. Through experimentation I’ve developed ways of writing, researching and managing flows of information that have worked well for me and I will post more about in the coming weeks.\n","date":"20 March 2020","permalink":"/posts/four-tools-to-work-better-from-home/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"There’s plenty being written at the moment about staying sane whilst working from home, adapting to the change of lifestyle, and maintaining effective communication with distant colleagues.","title":"Four tools I use to work better from home"},{"content":"I am currently supporting a higher education project in Tunisia and came across an interesting World Bank study considered to be the first of its kind. Final year undergraduates were given the opportunity to graduate with a business plan instead of following the standard curriculum, and were offered 120 hours of training that included ‘most of the components that are considered best-practice for entrepreneurship education’. The optional entrepreneurship track started in 2009/10 and has been running since.\nIn the first published analysis, short-term impacts were studied:\nthe entrepreneurship track was effective in increasing self-employment among applicants, but that the effects are small in absolute terms. In addition, the employment rate among participants remains unchanged, pointing to a partial substitution from wage employment to self-employment. The evidence shows that the program fostered business skills, expanded networks, and affected a range of behavioural skills. Participation in the entrepreneurship track also heightened graduates’ optimism toward the future shortly after the Tunisian revolution.\nA second paper, published in 2019, examined the medium-term impact using the same cohort:\nThe medium-term results show that the impacts of entrepreneurship education were short-lived. There are no sustained impacts on self-employment or employment outcomes four years after graduation. There are no lasting effects on latent entrepreneurship either, and the short-term increase in optimism also receded… the lack of medium-term impact holds across sub-groups based on gender, family wealth, skills or social capital.\nThere are several possible lessons to draw, beyond the clear difficulty of achieving lasting impact. The first is that integrating enterprise education alongside existing curricula, rather than a separate stream, could be an effective alternative. The second, as the second study suggests, is that other limitations are a bigger constraint than the nature of the training, especially accessing capital (there is evidence from Nigeria, cited in the paper, of monetary grants having long-term, positive impact). The third is the importance of continued coaching, training and mentoring beyond the initial period of study.\nBut what really struck me was how relatively unusual it is to come across randomised control trials of interventions in higher education (and especially published studies of those where the intervention did not work). Fields such as medicine abound with multi-year trials. Primary education has also seen its fair share – this years Nobel prize recognised the work of Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer popularised in the excellent book, Poor Economics. There are plenty of large-scale evaluations and analyses of higher education, particularly around student outcomes, but I struggle to think of large-scale, experimental interventions. My hunch is that, as recognition of the role of higher education in development and social change has increased, so too will demand for randomised control trials within the field.\nFailures wanted # The Tunisian study is helpful as it shows that a ‘common sense’ prescription (give students business and entrepreneurial skills instead of writing an academic thesis as part of their degree) to a commonly-perceived problem (unemployable graduates) simply did not work. I\u0026rsquo;d love to see more such studies. Sharing examples of what doesn’t work through large-scale, rigorous testing can be hugely valuable, albeit with the caveat that the results may not always be generalisable to other contexts. As I see it, several things need to be in place:\nThe basic parameters of an academic study: a control group who do not participate in the intervention, careful analysis of the context and environment, benchmarking and continued evaluation, etc. An acceptance that the intervention may fail. This is why the World Bank is perhaps better placed to fund such a study than the Tunisian government, who would be less willing or able to share widely the outcomes if the project failed, or to experiment with public funds. A longer-term (multi-year) perspective with no expectation of clear answers in the short term. A process of freely disseminating the findings and sharing what has (not) worked. A sufficiently big budget to launch and maintain a long-term effort, and to provide the capacity for effective experimentation, iteration and evaluation. The World Bank’s Tunisia Tertiary Education for Employability Project runs for over five years and commits 70 million USD. Crucially, these conditions combined distinguish a rigorous, experimental study from a public policy intervention. If you know of any other experimental, evidence-based studies in higher education – especially those that have been deemed to have not worked – please let me know by email or in the comments below.\nPhotos of Tunis, Tunisia from Unsplash.

As it is, advanced hydroponic vertical farms use fewer water resources and have lower transport miles than traditional crops. Often they are pesticide and herbicide-free. Here is one example of vertical farms being rolled out to some US campus universities, presumably for those students who don’t do beer and pizza. (Japan seems to have taken the lead in vertical farming, according to the FT.)\nUniversities have taken the lead in developing urban farming solutions. I discuss this (as an ‘unsung hero’ of ‘smart’ cities) in my British Council report. The twist here, of course, is the potential focus on quarantine and self-sufficiency, rather than sustainability and environmental protection. Such a movement might seem at odds with much of the narrative about cities (spun by both mayors and many urban commentators) as being open, interdependent and simultaneously local and global, but perhaps better reflects a shift towards locally-produced goods and globally-shared knowledge. As Azeem adds, the powerful response of the scientific community, and the open sourcing of intelligence in tackling the virus, bodes well for addressing future cross-border challenges (good coverage of the rapid response in The Economist here).\n(Photo by Emile-Victor Portenart on Unsplash)\n","date":"5 February 2020","permalink":"/posts/farming-coronavirus-cities/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"In a post today on six ways coronavirus will change our world, Azeem Azhar writes that the coronavirus might encourage self-sufficiency, especially around food, energy and products:","title":"Vertical farming, coronavirus and self-sufficient cities"},{"content":" Available here (external link, PDF 1.4mb).

And communities and civil society and the public sector… Parla italiano? 🇮🇹 This article is available in Italian on the MEET Digital Culture Centre website. My report for the British Council on universities and smart cities described the first wave of smart cities led by large technology companies such as IBM and Cisco, followed by bottom-up movements from civil society groups. The report concluded that universities can effectively bridge the two and ensure communities have a say. A couple of months after the final publication, I’m reflecting on how this picture varies outside of Europe (the focus of the research) and on additional forces that are shaping the story. Since publication I’ve briefly covered the dangers of smart city projects lacking effective partnerships in Canada, but there are two further movements that are worth keeping an eye on.\nTechnology giants # The first is smart cities by stealth. This movement enters through the back door (or, more accurately, is mounted onto your front door). Consumers purchase products like Ring, a doorbell fitted with a security camera, from Amazon. City hall is circumvented in the building of smart city networks, but is co-opted in later, as an excellent article in Wired (focusing on the US) explains:\nIn exchange for promoting Ring’s devices and its associated crime watch app Neighbors, cops are given access to a portal where they can ask citizens for footage from their cameras that may be connected to a crime without a warrant. The arrangements have come under growing scrutiny in recent months, as reporters and activists have criticised their lack of transparency and potential for privacy abuses. Public records obtained by journalists also show that Ring tightly controls how police officials can portray its dealings with the company.\nThese digital doorbells are motion-activated and detect activity up to around nine meters away. The creation of a massive net of video coverage managed by a private company has led 30 American civil rights organisations to ask government officials to investigate the company’s business practices and partnerships with police. Amazon has much bigger ambitions in this area. The company’s new ‘Sidewalk’ protocol extends the connectivity of devices outside the home. The first product is a rather innocuous-sounding tag for tracking the location of your dog (called ‘Fetch’). Another article from Wired explains how the use of such devices by even a minority of people can envelop communities:\nIn its testing, though, [Amazon] sent out 700 gateway devices to Amazon employees in the Los Angeles basin, and because each one has a range of between 500m and up to a mile, Amazon was able to \u0026ldquo;basically cover where everyone lives in LA\u0026rdquo;… An innocent smart dog tracker like Fetch fits perfectly into this model of Amazon-networked communities sharing video, alerts and location tracking.\nAuthoritarian regimes # The second movement is a reminder that in some places the first wave of smart cities - a ‘top-down’ approach led by governments and industry - never really went away. Instead this approach has intensified as technology becomes cheaper and more powerful. The website Coda has excellent coverage of what it calls ‘authoritarian tech’, including the darker side of smart city projects and how ‘authoritarian technologies lurk around the infrastructure of smart cities’. Examples include how Western companies are aiding the surveillance architecture of smart cities in China, how technology is assaulting the lives of ordinary Zimbabweans and how technology can be used to surveil minorities like Uyghurs in China.\nBypassing civil society # Two stories are being told. One is vast infrastructure projects delivered across cities at scale, the other an accretion of thousands of devices. One is city government procuring from one or two companies, the other thousands of consumer transactions. But both, as the protests of American civil rights organisations and the coverage of Coda shows, have a lack of oversight and accountability and transparency, and omit the likes of civil society, universities and other bodies that can add so much.

Some I knew about, others were new. It’s a helpful reminder that even universities, seen as one of the most dependable ‘anchor institutions’, can up and leave when they deem it necessary (although it is pretty rare).\nThe college of the future # One institution embedded in more communities and neighbourhoods than universities is the further education college - often overlooked in conversations about anchors. I joined a seminar last week by the Independent Commission on the College of the Future asking what we want and need from our colleges from 2030 onwards. Most discussions returned to the essential local role of colleges (and a lack of public appreciation for the wide-ranging responsibilities they take on), their ability to act as community and business hubs (especially for the long tail of less-productive small businesses), and as a conduit to higher education, careers and apprenticeships. This commission seems to have the ear of government, is chaired by the highly regarded Sir Ian Diamond (who has an extensive background in higher education, and will soon be the UK’s National Statistician), and is well-timed given the widely acknowledged need for support for the further education sector. The final report will be published in Spring 2020 and I expect it to be influential.\nBetter local data # I first wrote about the POLAR dataset back in 2016. It is helpful to measure the extent to which young people participate in higher education at a local level because where you are from is closely linked to your future education prospects, your health and your economic prosperity. The Office for Students has introduced an experimental but more sophisticated successor to POLAR called TUNDRA. Wonkhe have published a helpful summary with some of the limitations and context. More detailed data at a more local level is definitely a good thing - as with previous work by HEFCE on ‘cold spot’ areas that are missing a university. However, as data becomes more complex it often needs heavy caveating, as we have seen with the LEO data on graduate earnings - which is beginning to include a place dimension.\n","date":"27 September 2019","permalink":"/posts/when-anchors-move/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"Three loosely-related reflections on new things:","title":"When anchors move, hidden anchors, and local data"},{"content":"100 Resilient Cities closed its doors at the start of August. Although principally aimed at local governments and city administrations, the organisation’s focus on solving locally-identified challenges made it, in my opinion, highly relevant for universities. The three African cities in my doctoral research - Accra, Addis Ababa and Kigali - are all resilient cities. Several posts on this site focus on resilience (examples here and here). And I have interviewed the Chief Resilience Officers in Toronto and Milan for several research projects that have stressed the role of universities in tackling urban problems. There’s good coverage on CityLab and The Conversation on what the closure of 100 Resilient Cities means and some of the reasons for it being shuttered. Over on LinkedIn, Elliott Cappell, the former Chief Resilience Officer for the City of Toronto, posted an excellent analysis of the ascent and demise of 100 Resilient Cities, asking what can we learn. Elliott kindly gave permission for me to republish his post here - it’s well worth a read for considering what we can learn for similar future initiatives. Over to Elliott… —\nAs of August 1st, 2019, 100 Resilient Cities is winding down. # Yes, you read that correctly: the $160m, Rockefeller-backed, global organization with offices from Mexico City to Singapore, and Chief Resilience Officers in 80 cities, has shuttered its windows. This is a truly acute shock for anyone working on urban development, climate change, or international development. I remember the first day I walked into 100RC’s offices in Manhattan, because that was the day I met Otis Rolley (who was then an executive of 100RC). If you have met Otis, you will also recall your first time. Otis is so charismatic, so honest, and so intelligent that it defies description. It is hard not to like Otis. On that April day in 2017, Otis cited scripture to describe the ascent of 100RC and its network of CROs: “As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another”. The passage, in this context, meant that 100RC was growing, drawing in the best people, the greatest cities, and the brightest ideas - and so drawing in even better people, more partners, and better ideas. Otis was right, too. Yet, just 28 months later, 100RC is finished. Wow. How did this happen? If you are working in cities or climate change or development, it is worth trying to understand how 100RC went from ascent to demise in just two years. From my perspective, there are three lessons:\nIn public policy, simple ideas become complex very quickly. # In public policy, simple ideas become complex very quickly. 100RC started with a great idea: making cities around the world resilient to shocks, like Hurricane Katrina. They made it a bit more complex, by introducing the concept of ‘stresses’ that make those shocks worse, like poor land use planning or institutional racism. Tackling ‘shocks and stresses’ was a huge, audacious idea, literally with the potential to change the world. But then 100RC made it much more complex. They promised resilience wouldn’t just be focused on the pending doom of climate change, but would actually solve ‘any challenges cities faced’. They would create a ‘marketplace for resilience’, and ‘innovative finance for resilience’. 100RC’s approach was documented in a ‘guidance manual’ of _hundreds of pages, _in which ‘meetings’ became ‘bootcamps’; ‘consultants’ became ‘strategy partners’; and ‘discovery areas’ would feed into cities’ ‘opportunity assessments’. Even the press releases are complex enough that it is really hard to understand what 100RC is doing or why. Cities are complex systems, so it’s hard to simplify and still create meaningful change. But the 100RC strategy should have been simpler; because simple becomes complex, and in this case, complex became unachievable.\nIf you get the local political economy wrong, your project will fail. # **100RC’s second challenge **was to apply their model, which was based on American cities’ governance, to cities around the world. But cities are governed differently around the world. For example, as CRO in Toronto, I reported to the City Manager, who is like the CEO of the city, whereas our Mayor is like the Chairperson of the Board. But in New York, the CRO reports to the Mayor, who is CEO and Chairperson both. In international development, we refer to these subtle but very important differences as ‘the local political economy’. If you get the local political economy wrong, your project will fail. From my perspective on the ground, 100RC was not able to internalize the differences between New York and Toronto - which are only an hour away by plane. Those differences created massive barriers to implementing 100RC’s model in our context. Now multiply that problem by 100 cities across dozens of countries, and you have a second reason 100RC is shut today: local political economy matters. The third reason is money. 100RC spent lots and lots of money. Annually, 100RC flew dozens of tech entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to Italy, where they were served meals literally topped with edible gold leaves (or gold leafs, in Toronto’s political economy). They held a ‘resilience track’ at the Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas (Vegas was not a 100RC city). They held ‘learning labs’ around the world on a range of topics such as a ‘city currency’, and they spent lots doing so. What do Las Vegas, a city currency, or consumer electronics have to do with protecting cities from climate change? Didn’t we start this whole thing because of Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy? Where was climate change in all this spending? One can draw a connection from venture capital to city resilience (100RC tried), but it certainly isn’t straightforward. If you’re working on public policy or using public resources, you need to keep tightly accountable to linking your budget with your outcomes. It isn’t easy to explain why using philanthropic funds for ‘living labs’ and ‘platform partners’ (100RC parlance for site visits and for short term consulting advice) leads to improved resilience. So the third lesson here is that monitoring and evaluation is crucial: tracking to clear metrics help us demonstrate that money is leading to change.\n100RC was successful and continues to be relevant, as climate change causes problems faster than cities are coming up with solutions. # 100RC was not a failure. In a short time there has been a substantial change in how cities act and think, and it’s very impressive how much was achieved. With most people living in cities and the climate causing problems faster than we come up with solutions, 100RC is actually still relevant. That 100RC was successful and is relevant makes today feel like a brutal, bruising failure. I hope many other people in our industry share their thoughts on how we got here. 100RC was a very important organization, and it is important that we, as urban development, climate change, and international development professionals, own and understand this as a collective failure. If, by the grace of the Rockefeller Foundation, we get another shot at helping cities combat climate change, we need to identify and learn the lessons from 100RC’s demise. -Elliott\nRead the original post on LinkedIn here.

But here, researchers from the nearby University of Nottingham are planning to launch a “deep farm” that could produce ten times as much food as farms above ground. Deep farms are an example of what the latest wave of smart cities look like: putting people first by focusing on solving urban problems and improving existing infrastructure, rather than opening shiny new buildings. These smart cities look nothing like science fiction. In fact, the sleek, futuristic visions often used to promote smart cities tend to alienate residents. Isolated high-tech buildings, streets or cities can foster social inequality, and even free WiFi and bike-sharing schemes mainly benefit the affluent. So instead of chasing ribbon-cutting opportunities in city centres, planners, community leaders and researchers are coming together to tackle mundane but serious issues, such as improving poor quality housing, safeguarding local food supplies and transitioning to renewable energy. In my own research, commissioned by the British Council, I looked at how new projects and partnerships with universities in eight European cities are making life better for residents, through the clever use of technology. You may already be living in a smart city – here’s what to look out for.\nMore voices # [caption id=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; align=\u0026ldquo;alignright\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;253\u0026rdquo;] Students bridging the divide.\nAndrés Gerlotti/Unsplash. FAL.[/caption]\nThese new smart cities are getting communities and universities involved, alongside big companies and city authorities. This has helped shift the focus of smart city projects onto the needs of residents. During my interviews in cities across Europe – from Bucharest, Romania to Warsaw, Poland and Zaragoza, Spain – I found that university students and researchers have played an active role in this, consulting with residents and working with city hall to promote cooperation between citizens and local institutions. Universities produce a wealth of knowledge about the kinds of problems facing cities, and there is often a need to make more people aware of new research, so they can shape it, use it and build on it. In Milan, the City School initiative brings together the Municipality of Milan and six local universities to discuss issues facing the city. Universities take turns to showcase research and activities, and city officials test urban policy ideas with experts. But above all, communities are now part of the conversation. The EU-funded Sharing Cities programme, led by city halls and universities in London, Lisbon and Milan, has the audacious goal of proving that at least half of the 15,000 locals affected by improvements have actively participated in the process. As such, city authorities have worked with residents to design and implement smart city technologies including smart lampposts, energy management and e-mobility (smart parking, car sharing, electric charging points and so on) – but also to ensure these changes actually improve their lives.\nMore complexity # Successful smart city projects blend disciplines, bringing together experts in behavioural change alongside specialists in artificial intelligence and information technologies. Interdisciplinary work can be messy and difficult, it can take longer and may not always work – but when it does, it can bring real benefits to cities. For instance, Nottingham City Council and Nottingham Trent University have been part of the Remourban regeneration programme, working across sectors with cities around Europe. Homes in the Nottingham suburb of Sneinton have been upgraded with new outside walls and windows, a solar roof and a state of the art heating system - a process that takes just a few days. The result is improved insulation and reduced energy bills for residents, but also better public health: calculations suggest that bad housing costs the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) £1.4 billion a year, and improving the quality of homes can cut visits to local doctors almost by half.\n[caption id=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; align=\u0026ldquo;aligncenter\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;600\u0026rdquo;] Darmstadt, Germany.

For smart city projects to be embraced by residents, the benefits of new technologies need to be balanced against the need to manage privacy and security concerns. Darmstadt has set up an ethics advisory committee and has a strong focus on cyber security. The city was recently crowned winner of the German Digital City competition, and the municipal government is now working with other German cities to share what has worked.\nMore places # The new wave of smart cities spreads improvements beyond the city centre, with universities from France to Ireland running initiatives to bring residents from surrounding areas onto campus, and take their expertise into local communities. For instance, when Technological University Dublin and Dublin City Council came together to develop a new campus in the deprived district of Grangegorman, they opened it up to the rest of the city. The community eat with the students in the canteen, new buildings reuse material from the old site, renewable energy is stored locally, with excess power released onto the grid, and signage throughout the campus is the same as the rest of the city, blurring the edges between the university and the city. Technology can play an important and often decisive role in tackling urban problems. But the smart city of the future is more likely to be defined by quieter upgrades to existing infrastructure and new partnerships that better represent residents, than flashy new developments that resemble visions from science fiction.

They correctly note that having a strategy does not mean having a strategic approach. Drawing on a survey of 907 universities from 126 countries, they conclude that \u0026rsquo;the presence of an institution-wide policy/strategy for internationalisation, as well as the presence of a dedicated office or team to oversee its implementation, are becoming the norm at HEIs around the world’. Both the presence of a strategy and of dedicated teams have grown significantly over the past 15 years, according to previous survey data. However, the development of monitoring frameworks has ‘stagnated’, and the authors find a risk of a gulf opening up between those institutions who choose to (and can afford to be) strategic about internationalisation, and those who are less engaged. These discussions build on two related strands of work I’ve been involved with in the past: universities working with cities on internationalisation (with a central conclusion being a need for ‘strategic internationalisation’), and the ineffectiveness of many university engagement strategies. On the latter, and with a UK-focus, this post on the HEPI blog is worth a read: ‘almost 63% of university strategies have end dates in 2019, 2020 or 2021 and hence will need to be re-written and re-launched over the next few years’.

I am delighted to have recently joined Yorkshire Universities as an Associate. Last month Andy Haldane, Chief Economist at the Bank of England, gave a speech at the University of Sheffield asking if all economics, like politics, is ultimately local. The speech attracted attention for its discussion of whether we can capture and model detailed data on the economy at a far more local level. But there are two other points in the speech worth exploring further. The first is recognition that higher education, alongside financial services and the creative industries, are sectors that ‘exhibit the highest economic complexity and thus potentially generate the highest value-added’. Economic complexity means the amount of embedded knowledge. Translated into places, a high level of economic complexity means a diverse set of highly-specialised industries, and tends to result in a more prosperous place. Secondly, Haldane discusses the Bank’s response to the ‘deficit in public understanding and the deficit in public trust’ that central banks are facing. The Bank has responded by rolling out citizens’ panels across the UK, with independent chairs from the local area. Some of this discussion mirrors the public discourse around the role of universities in society, with the flurry of institutions signing Civic University Agreements and reasserting their public missions a reaction to this. The Bank has had a network of 15 regional branches since 1825. Many universities have a long history of civic engagement. There has, however, been a clear need for both to demonstrate this more clearly to those who stand to gain the most in areas which have traditionally been served the least. Taken together, these two points nicely capture two key roles of universities: generators of knowledge and the economic benefit that can result, and shapers of place and society. I make this point in a recent report for the British Council, noting that these two roles are significant because they challenge different ends of the traditional university mission: research and the so-called ‘third mission’ of economic and social engagement. The report looked at universities and the development of ‘smart’ cities across Europe, concluding that work between universities and city hall often draws on both of these missions, which prove to overlap and reinforce each other. The urgent calls for universities to ‘do more’ for their place, the challenges that local areas are facing, the strengths that universities have, and the work that they are doing, mean there has never been a better time for universities to build stronger links with their LEP, Combined Authority, and Metro Mayor partners.\nWhen partnerships are missing # A couple of days after my report on universities and smart cities was launched, a smart city project in Toronto hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Plans for a Google-affiliated company to redevelop land near the waterfront met with opposition from citizen groups concerned about long-term motives and a lack of transparency. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three levels of government over its plans to build the smart neighbourhood. So what went wrong? Clearly a lack of effective citizen consultation - a basic prerequisite for any smart city initiative - is part of the problem. I would also expect any successful project to have at least some involvement of universities. Given the complexity of any widespread urban development scheme, bringing in universities would have been a sensible move (but not a panacea), especially given the excellent work of Toronto’s universities in relation to the development of the city that I\u0026rsquo;ve explored elsewhere.\nProactive universities # If we take all of this together - the value of higher education to local economies, the need to build trust with people who live in these places, and ambitious regeneration projects that go wrong - we are reminded of the unique position of universities as powerful institutions that can connect communities, decision-makers and the private sector. In this connecting position, with an obligation to support all three but beholden to none, universities have difficult decisions to make. Given limited time and resources, these can require tricky trade-offs. Often universities contribute to activity in local areas where they are not necessarily obliged to act, but in doing so can add great value. One such area is in place promotion and the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI). Such activity can boost the prospects of communities and businesses (and increase the economic complexity of a place). It is also essential if we are to meet the government’s target to increase innovation and R\u0026amp;D investment to 2.4 percent of GDP. At Yorkshire Universities we are exploring the role that universities are playing, and the further contribution they can make, to increase trade and FDI in Yorkshire. In doing so, we are reminded again of the crucial dual role universities play, as generators of knowledge and shapers of place.

The report draws on interviews with nearly 50 university staff and city officials in eight cities from Bucharest to Zaragoza. It sets out how universities can help build successful ‘smart cities’, but also the dangers faced if they don’t get it right. Read it here (link to report at bottom of page). Here’s the intro: A simple message runs through this report: universities are needed to help tackle the serious challenges faced by towns and cities across Europe. Climate change and changing job markets are complex problems needing a wide-ranging response. Poor quality housing and pollution have plagued cities for centuries and progress will require new partnerships. City leaders should include universities in the fight against these challenges, and in the push to build better societies. Cities need to upgrade universities from advisory roles to actively shaping and delivering projects. But the real onus lies with universities themselves. Universities need to align themselves with the priorities of the city, to be proactive in building partnerships, and to make sometimes difficult internal changes to better meet local needs. Thousands of partnerships, projects and pilots are being delivered across Europe - from multi-city programmes to neighbourhood initiatives, some in places at the top of smart city league tables and renowned for their research and innovation, and others in regions grappling with economic uncertainty. Yet leaders and planners across the continent share common challenges. Budgets are tight, populations are growing, and new threats and challenges are appearing. City leaders are required to think beyond their city centre to the broader metropolitan area, balancing regional and national relationships whilst forging new international links. They shoulder growing responsibilities for their city to tick the latest urban policy boxes - to be resilient, sustainable and smart. Universities are also under financial strain, and often juggle teaching and research with the mantle of being civic institutions. Whilst many university leaders understand that this civic role - to help coordinate social and economic activity, to be a good neighbour and positively shape the place they are in - strengthens their teaching and research, challenges remain. Universities are being called to seek tighter integration with their environment, to form stronger bonds with local communities, and deliver more effective projects with longer term impact whilst growing national and international networks, all within a complex political arena. Even in places with a track record of local partners effectively working together, new thinking and new ideas are required. This report takes you on a tour of eight European cities. It explores how universities and city hall are working together to tackle the challenges faced in each city. Each city has a unique configuration of institutions and a different history of collaboration between the city hall and local universities. In some cities, both sides are building on decades of close working, in others universities are balancing a history of state control whilst exploring new opportunities to work with city officials. All eight cities, however, illustrate a broader trend - the emergence of a new wave of smart cities, placing universities at the heart of a more inclusive, human-focused movement to build better places and societies.\nSmart cities redefined # In 1975 NASA drew up plans for a colony in outer space. Called Stanford Torus, the colony would resemble a small city - housing up to 140,000 residents, drawing on the latest technology, and designed to be completely self-sufficient. Stanford Torus is worth considering for two reasons. The first is a reminder that we have been thinking about ‘smart’ cities, and how the latest technology can meet our needs, for a long time (the expansion of Barcelona 150 years ago was designed around the telegraph and railroad). The second is the close resemblance between the artist impressions of Stanford Torus in 1975 and promotional visions of the future city when the hype around smart cities hit around the year 2013. Discussion around smart cities in 2013 was focused on issues of technology, control, efficiency gains and large infrastructure upgrades, and was driven in part by multinational companies. In his excellent book Smart Cities, published around this period, Anthony Townsend described a vacuum between the top-down, technology-heavy solutions for cities promoted by big companies, and the bottom-up but limited-scale grassroots work of community activists. The smart city of 2019 looks quite different to that of 2013. The utopian visions have mostly gone (as we will see, they tended to alienate citizens). Movements towards ‘smart governance’ and ‘smart citizenship’ have grown, embodied in initiatives such as open data platforms. This ‘second wave’ of smart cities favours incremental improvements to existing infrastructure rather than entirely new systems. The spotlight is on the needs of residents rather than on glamorous new buildings. Technology may play an important part in solving problems, but it doesn’t look like science fiction. And culture and politics have joined the party - the path to the future city may now be a little messier and a bit noisier, but it is also more realistic and more achievable. Accordingly, this report uses a new definition of smart cities: using new ideas and innovations (which might include technology) to improve cities for the people who live, work and visit there. Townsend predicted that mayors would step into the vacuum between industry and activists and design the smart city of the future. He was right - but mayors and their teams have company. Organisations such as universities can bolster the work of city hall by drawing on the vast amount of research and innovation they deliver, but also working in closer partnership with city hall. This requires universities to concentrate on where they can really add the most value, and for both university and city leaders to pay attention to developing strong processes and structures for collaboration. Universities also work closely with large and small businesses who continue to be an essential part of this partnership. And their work with communities can help ensure a constant focus on inclusivity and participation. This report shows how eight European cities are doing just that.\nRead the full report here!\n(Image credits: photo by Valik Chernetskyi; Stanford Torus artist impressions here and here)\n","date":"15 May 2019","permalink":"/posts/smart-places-report/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"My latest report for the British Council was launched in Berlin at Going Global a few hours ago.","title":"Smart places – how universities are shaping a new wave of smart cities"},{"content":" Available here (external link).

Universities benefit when they work closely with diverse groups of people: communities, businesses, international visitors. Therefore it makes sense for universities to be as ‘open’ as possible and to exist as spaces and places that make (1) and (2) possible. Why, then, are many universities pretty poor at putting (3) into practice? There are some that do this well: in the UK, a university in the north east that chose to build a five-a-side football pitch on a piece of prime campus real estate, rather than financially lucrative labs or incubator space, to encourage local youth to play and become comfortable on campus. Or the university shaping its campus to provide a new short-cut from the train station to the city centre, and showing off the work of students and the facilities of the university for all those walking through. Internationally, I’ve written previously about Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, and Ryerson in Toronto.\nBut these are exceptions. Many university buildings - at least in the UK - are woefully under-utilised, and security concerns tend to trump openness and access. Tuition fees act as a wall, restricting access to university buildings to those who pay the fees. In contrast you can walk straight into and work within many of the excellent libraries in universities across Europe. Universities should be places for people to meet and ideas to flow, and they need to be open and welcoming environments. Fortunately there are models of excellence to learn from.\nHelsinki’s Library Oodi # Last week I visited Helsinki’s new public library - a glistening 98m euro building near the Central Railway Station and spread over three floors. There were several thousand people within the building when I visited, but it didn’t feel crowded. The library’s website tells the story better than I could here, but there are some key points universities could learn from:\nThe library markets itself as a ‘living meeting place’ that is ‘open for all’, functioning as ‘a living room for residents’. It is truly open - no need to sign up, no turnstiles. As the Johns Hopkins example above showed, when you strip down the perimeter or facade you invite foot traffic and create a safer environment, but you also truly engage (signing up for a free membership may seem inclusive, but there are always parts of society who will be excluded by this). As such, Oodi reimagines what a library should be for. There are still 100,000 books on the top floor, but the space has been designed from scratch to reflect today’s society. The second floor has an ‘urban workshop’ containing 3D printers, sewing machines, large format printers and computing equipment. There are also meeting and conference rooms, online gaming rooms - all available to the public. Anyone can pick a tablet up from the shelf. There’s a vast amount of comfortable seating - some in quiet zones, others resembling a co-working space. Freelancers, businesses, tourists, residents, students, families are all catered for. What would a university building that did this look like? There’s a consultation area, where residents can look at models of city plans, view new developments with VR headsets, and provide feedback notes on a giant map of the city. And the building itself was designed with an emphasis on service design and user input. The basics are all covered. There’s very fast internet (no login), long opening hours, a good restaurant and multiple coffee shops, and full accessibility. It’s big enough to never feel too busy. One might argue that all this comes at a huge cost - and why give all this away for free (or why should universities provide such services, when state-run institutions such as libraries should do so). But there’s a real competitive advantage to be found from being the provider of such a space - the ideas that can be generated, connections made, and the long-term engagement with community that could help break down some of the barriers in society. It’s an investment in a place and people - a gift that pays interest in stronger relationships into the future.\nThere’s also a high degree of trust involved in completely opening doors to all (which I think the UK struggles with more than some of our European counterparts). What if crime skyrockets, or people decide they don’t want to pay for study when they can use facilities for free? Risks indeed, but my guess is the more people that flow through from all parts of society, the lower the crime. And the more people who see what such an institution can offer, the more they are willing to support it.\n(Photos: Tuomas Uusheimo)\n","date":"17 January 2019","permalink":"/posts/universities-can-learn-from-libraries/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"Most people interested in the role of universities in society would, I think, agree on the following:","title":"What universities can learn from excellent libraries about public space"},{"content":" This post first appeared on Wonkhe.\nWriting an effective strategy for local engagement is difficult.\nRead through the following statements, taken from a UK university’s strategic plan, and see if anything looks familiar:\nAs a vibrant knowledge hub, we have an important role to play both locally and globally. The university is a large employer and economic contributor in the region.\nWe aim to build a clear and distinctive reputation for excellence through strategic engagement and communication with our regional, national and international communities.\nWe will help the region address its challenges and opportunities while incorporating its many possibilities in education and research.\nCould this be from your university’s strategic plan or external engagement strategy? I actually lied at the start: these statements aren’t from a single university. They’re a jumbled mix of statements from five universities from across the UK nations, and from various mission groups. But if they look familiar this could be a problem.\nA Barnum effect? # Speaking at recent events, I’ve asked the audience - mostly of higher education professionals - whether these statements about engagement could be from their strategic plan. Nearly everyone raises their hand.\nThis reminds me, perhaps a little uncharitably, of the Barnum effect. Emerging from a series of psychological experiments in the 1940s, the effect involves showing participants - for example, a class of students - an individual personality statement based on a handwriting sample or a piece of written work. Statements include:\nYou have a great need for other people to like and admire you. You have a tendency to be critical of yourself. You have a great deal of unused capacity which you have not turned to your advantage. Because the assessment statements are so vague, people interpret their own meaning, and the statements become personal to them. Nearly all participants believed their assessment to be uncannily accurate.\nEngagement expectations # There is a growing expectation for universities to be regionally engaged, and this follows from a recognition of the role universities can play in their area and with local communities. The interest and enthusiasm around the Civic University Commission is evidence of this.\nThis local role isn’t new. Many universities have had engagement as a core part of their mission since their founding. But in recent years government has focused on the role of cities and regions in devolved policymaking, as well as the institutions, such as universities, that can help steer this.\nAs regional plans - from City Deals to Local Industrial Strategies - shape the policy environment university planners need to factor the issue of place more highly. Often, however, the result is strangely place-neutral: a series of engagement strategies and university planning documents that are largely indistinguishable from one another.\nPlace, positioning and partnerships # There are positives to be drawn from my (admittedly unscientific) scan of university engagement strategies. Many recognise how the local and international activities of universities reinforce each other. Universities are bridges for their towns, cities and regions to reach the world, and this offer to connect the local and the global is made loud and clear.\nIn my work for the British Council on universities and cities working together on internationalisation, I found that effective planning was built on a deep understanding of place, positioning and partnerships. It is long-term, deliberate and part of a wider vision of the future of the local area. Universities often have a clear sense of their positioning, but articulating this in the context of place and partnerships can be tricky.\nUniversity strategies are not the place to detail individual activities and actions. But a greater degree of specificity is often needed, and this is likely to mean dropping some of the broad statements to focus on a few areas of institutional strength, perhaps joining up with other local universities.\nRooting strategies in place, positioning and partnerships is a good start. The Civic University Commission’s progress report notes that measuring civic engagement is not widespread (but does highlight Cardiff University’s use of quantitative and qualitative analysis). Further work on this is also important.\nA good incentive to write a long-term strategy (image credit)\nSo too is taking a longer-term perspective. Many universities proudly promote their anchor presence in their area, but their plans are often on five or ten-year cycles. The city of Amsterdam has a 200-year strategy. Although this is prompted by climate change (as an official said, “we don\u0026rsquo;t want to just let the water flow and all have to move to Germany”), thinking about what a university strategy spanning one or two centuries may look like is perhaps a useful exercise.\nA test when looking at your university engagement strategy: if you remove your institution’s name, and mix it up in a pot with other anonymised strategies, is it clear which strategy is yours?\nMain image credit\n","date":"22 November 2018","permalink":"/posts/how-to-write-engagement-strategy/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"This post first appeared on Wonkhe.","title":"How to write an engagement strategy"},{"content":" Available here (external link).

Here’s the pitch:\nAs more and more smart technologies are incorporated into the fabric of our cities, it has become increasingly pressing to ensure that those technologies reach the audiences they are intended to reach. This presentation introduces the concept of ‘inadvertent exclusion’, where potential users or consumers of smart city technologies are found not to engage with the possibilities that those smart initiatives can offer. It is argued that this may be the result of a misunderstanding of the importance of social difference in the way that cities work.\nThe research is based on the ESRC-funded project Smart Cities in the Making: Learning from Milton Keynes. The project asks how people in a smart city engage with smart technologies, and what difference the smart city makes. These are important questions. They also remind me of two related pieces of work. The first is the notion of ‘splintering urbanism’, whereby urban infrastructure can drive social and spatial inequality. The book is full of examples of both deliberate and inadvertent boundaries:\nIn Baltimore… [urban geographer] David Harvey notes the paradox that, whilst African American women cross these boundaries daily to clean some of the world\u0026rsquo;s most famous hospitals (for example Johns Hopkins), they are unable to access health services when they are ill because of a lack of health insurance. Meanwhile \u0026ldquo;life expectancy in the immediate environs of these internationally renowned hospital facilities is among the lowest in the nation and comparable to many of the poorer countries of the world\u0026rdquo;.\nThe second is the 2013 book, The Blunders of our Governments. If you don’t have time to read the book, this review in the Guardian is helpful. It’s worth quoting in full this explanation of how many blunders arise from a disconnect born from ignorance or social and cultural divides:\nThe causes of the blunders were numerous. In many cases, ministers and their senior officials were simply ignorant – King and Crewe politely call it \u0026ldquo;cultural disconnect\u0026rdquo; – of how large sections of the population lived from day to day. The Tories had no inkling that, if sent a poll tax bill of several hundred pounds, some families, and particularly elderly couples, would not be able to pay. \u0026ldquo;Well, they could always sell a picture,\u0026rdquo; suggested Nicholas Ridley, the then environment secretary and the son of a viscount, apparently in all seriousness. But Labour has become almost equally disconnected from real life, with its frontbenchers and advisers increasingly drawn from a cohort that went from school to university (usually Oxbridge) to Westminster thinktank without ever working in a retail store, a hamburger joint or a benefit office. Its tax credits scheme involved paying out weekly or monthly a sum that was determined annually. Millions of people short of money, many of whom had never previously completed a tax return, had to fill out complex forms about their previous year\u0026rsquo;s earnings, estimate earnings for the following year and notify the authorities each time their circumstances changed. The scheme, as the head of the Inland Revenue admitted, went \u0026ldquo;spectacularly wrong\u0026rdquo;.\nThis month I begin a tour looking at the role of universities in smart cities in eight European countries, for an exciting research project commissioned by the British Council. One question I’ll be trying to answer is how universities may be able to help prevent blunders, exclusion and splintering in the development of smart cities.

One of the things I like to test with the audience is a sliding scale I\u0026rsquo;ve developed1 of why universities choose to engage with local communities, businesses and other organisations: 1. Financial incentives 2. Government push through policy (e.g. for knowledge transfer) 3. Branding; demonstrating social relevance 4. Enlightened self interest 5. Public/local/civic duty; (rediscovering) a historic mission 6. A strategic \u0026lsquo;urban turn\u0026rsquo; The theory is that, over time, many universities have moved from point one - choosing to engage locally because of perceived or actual financial benefits - to point five - a sense that engagement is part of the duty of the institution. The route is rarely a straightforward journey through all five, and in the messy reality of day-to-day engagement many stages will look remarkably similar. Between financial incentives and civic duty we have universities responding to government policy pushes (point two), described well by the likes of Rhiannon Pugh and colleagues regarding initiatives such as Growth Hubs in the UK. Point three - engagement as a means to improving an institution’s branding and demonstrating social relevance - is often a scrambled response to universities coming under fire (usually from the press) for being societally irrelevant or out of touch. Enlightened self interest, point four, is the recognition that the fortunes of a university are often closely intertwined with the health of its locality. Point five is having civic duty at the heart of the university mission. This is garnering a lot of attention in the UK through the likes of the UPP Civic University Commission but, for many universities, is aspirational at present. Point six I’ve written about extensively on this blog. It combines points one to five, and proposes that the relationship between universities and cities is evolving. For some universities, the city has become a greater strategic concern and opportunity. There is evidence of universities slowly undertaking an ‘inward’ or local turn, from nation to city - for example university leaders prioritising city trade delegations over national ones - and institutions looking to take advantage of the globalisation of urbanisation and responding to the narrative over the ‘rise of cities’ and their interconnectedness. At the same time, universities themselves become vehicles for cities to achieve their goals - but I’ll save this for another post.\nLocating the Urban University slides # [slideshare id=120567258\u0026amp;doc=locatingtheurbanuniversity-181024140523]\nFinding Dan | Dan Grinwis\nWith many influences, who shouldn’t be held accountable for my findings.

There could also be ‘pockets’ of internationalisation in more marginalised areas where universities set up a summer school, ran public events, built student residences or held community engagement activities.\nThe thinking was that universities could help bring the benefits of internationalisation to these ‘cold spots’. I’ve been thinking about the concept of a heatmap of university-city interaction in more detail and sketch out some initial thoughts below.\nWhat is hot? # Beyond international activity, there are many other interesting dimensions a heatmap could capture. A basic map may capture any initiative between universities and city hall, between universities and businesses, or between universities and communities or community organisations. Darker shading may represent scale of activity or depth of engagement or a longer history of working together.\nLess tangibly, it could represent informal collaboration, or any activity where the university reinforces the goals of city hall or supports communities, or vice versa. Activity that undermines other actors might emit a chilling shade of blue; a warming red means partners working towards similar goals.\nHeat could represent individuals participating in higher education or people otherwise engaging with a university - from attending a public lecture to using sports facilities. It could capture the flow of these people to and from their home or workplace and the university, showing how their engagement is shaping transport use and public spaces. Movement patterns will differ from university to university and each tell a unique story (Toronto’s universities are jointly studying the travel behaviour of 600,000 students).\nInstead of mobility, the flow of money or investment in and out of universities could be measured. In doing so we would veer into the territory of university impact studies and input-output analysis. Given the limitations of such studies, a heatmap approach with added contextual data may offer a more complete picture of regional impact. A broader impact heatmap may look at perception data or a combination of economic, social and cultural measures.\nA map could show ownership. Most obviously this could be the land and buildings owned by the universities (perhaps a more granular version of this data from the UK showing the dominance of the Oxford and Cambridge estates). In cities that have a degree of ‘ownership’ of institutions (through regulatory controls or funding mechanisms) the degree of autonomy could be mapped.\nOr we could (try to) map where collaboration or engagement is less or more than expected. This mirrors nuanced higher education participation data produced in the UK (my post on that here) which maps the proportion of young people participating in higher education compared to that expected given GCSE-level attainment and ethnic profile. How we measure or define what is expected given the different make up of cities and universities is an interesting question, and leads us nicely to…\nMapping complexity # Heatmaps offer a nice visual representation of the heterogeneity and complexity of both universities and cities. ‘The city’ is made up of countless constituent parts, and it is similarly difficult to generalise ‘the university’ as a single actor. Even the most outward-looking university will have departments and teams with strong engagement with people outside the institution and others which remain mostly insulated from outside.\nWe can apply heatmapping to universities. Here’s the organogram for Hungary’s University of Physical Education (ranked highly in Google Image Search), with a completely fictitious heatmap applied that could apply to international or community or business engagement. You can get even more detailed: within each unit you could shade each individual. And university structures change over time, and in turn so does the heatmap shading. You could do a similar exercise across a map of the campus.\nThe organogram for Hungary’s University of Physical Education\nA unique heatmap signature # Every city and every university will have a unique heatmap \u0026lsquo;signature’. This is partly affected by the structure of the city itself: a heatmap for Paris would look very different to London or Dublin or Baltimore or Toronto. A long history of city planning, the decisions of millions of individuals and thousands of businesses and organisations, political and cultural and social and economic forces lends urban areas a unique fingerprint. In Paris social housing is concentrated in the banlieues or suburbs that form a ring around the centre of the city, whereas in London social housing is woven into the fabric of the city. The result can be intense spots next to each other, or softer scattered blobs.\nUniversities are actors that make decisions but simultaneously are themselves shaped by wider forces. Dublin City University is in a historically poorer part of the city whereas Trinity College Dublin is right in the centre, forging their own unique heatmap signatures. In Toronto the four main universities have very different footprints and very different heatmap signatures. In London, three universities that may be seen by some as institutionally similar are engaging in vast campus expansions in new areas of the city. The heat signatures for UCL, Imperial and Kings College London will show a new, emerging concentration of heat in their new campuses, a second centre of gravity which - depending on what you are measuring and the success of their developments - may over time have implications for their existing sites, the surrounding areas and all the bits in-between. London South Bank University is focusing on working with local partners such as further education colleges in the borough of Southwark; again, the signature for LSBU would look quite different to UCL. Precisely where you are located matters.\nHeatmaps may also be a good way of visualising activity on the ‘periphery’ - a focus of recent academic inquiry from higher education to smart cities.\nA US university\u0026rsquo;s campus map\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;with a fictional heatmap\nIs there a dark side to universities? # Not all university impact and engagement is positive. Complaints may be relatively trivial - from students taking over too many houses to making too much noise or not paying enough local taxes. But they can also be more serious criticisms: universities that exacerbate ‘existing cleavages of class and race’ in the race to redevelop and expand their campus, or otherwise reproduce wider inequalities in society. Such conversations often emerge when universities embark on urban regeneration projects - a prime candidate for heat mapping - and the debate often intersects with wider discussions of gentrification and community identity.\nThe Guardian explored some of these issues earlier this year in coverage of Johns Hopkins University’s ambitious development plans in east Baltimore. The piece quoted several locals:\n“This is gentrification, a big institution pushing out a vulnerable community for its benefit,” says Lawrence Brown, a critical urbanist who teaches in the school of community health and policy at Morgan State, Baltimore’s historically black university… Marisela Gomez, a physician and activist in the fight for fair treatment of displaced residents, is blunter. “Every community that’s black and brown and low-income in Baltimore is at risk.”\nThere’s also an acceptance that the city needs the university. “We need Hopkins to succeed, because that’s the anchor institution in east Baltimore” says the leader of the ‘Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development’ group. And the university recognises the interdependence of the university and the city: “It is inconceivable that Hopkins would remain a pre-eminent institution in a city that continues to suffer decline”.\nBaltimore rowhouses (image credit)\nNeedless to say, mapping such interactions needs to be supported by broad contextualisation. And ideally mapping would reflect some other, significant, changes taking place, such as a blurring of the edges around the campus:\nWith fences, skywalks and forbidding facades broken by loading docks, the medical campus sent hostile signals to its surroundings, and got hostility in return. Assault and theft were common; beggars set up at traffic lights. “Fundamentally it was a hunker-down strategy,” [Ron] Daniels [president of Johns Hopkins University] says. “The traditional thinking was that the best way to protect the university was to ensure that its perimeters were effectively controlled, and that you were creating safe zones within them.” \u0026hellip; By contrast, the new office and lab buildings in the EBDI [East Baltimore Development Initiative] feel like they welcome – and want to generate – foot traffic. It is nothing fancy: ground floor retail, some steps and patios, small setbacks creating spaces to meet and gather.\nMessiness and other issues # The shift from forbidding facades to open spaces could be tricky to map, as could other ‘novel’ sites such as mixed-use buildings that combine shops, cinemas and lecture theatres, or - to give an example from northern England - five-a-side football pitches on prime university estate to get young people comfortable being on campus.\nThere are other limitations. Maps can be stubbornly one-dimensional: they often show a fixed point in time, whereas patterns will change from day to night and times of the year. Unless they can show effectiveness or durability or inclusivity there is a risk of giving the illusion of successful engagement; some projects could create bold heat maps despite having largely negative effects.\nWith the development of ‘smart cities’ you can, in real time, transpose data onto the map. Although sensor information may show supposed engagement, the data is technical and the metrics unlikely to accurately reflect social realities. Maps need to capture phenomena such as ‘splintering urbanism’, whereby urban infrastructure can drive social and spatial inequality.\nLastly, consideration should be given to how to represent regional, national and international dimensions. To pick just one facet of international links, universities that are close to global flight hubs perform better in league tables, and cheap flights mean more research partnerships; similarly places with a direct flight to Silicon Valley raise more venture capital. But these links won’t benefit all people in the city or parts of the university and a heatmap could help us consider how benefits can be spread further.\nIf you want yet more reading, here’s a short article recently published by NCEE where I set out the long-term focus universities can bring to planning.

This time, it is the FT looking at UCL’s rapid expansion into east London following reports of academic unease over the institution’s plans. There’s a quite a bit to unpack in the article, from universities as city brands (a big part of this work for the British Council), to the globalisation of higher education and the forces compelling relentless campus expansion within urban areas. But the crux of the article is this:\nUCL is not alone in seeking to expand to secure its place in the world’s premier league of universities. New York University, founded at about the same time, has opened a technology hub in Brooklyn, and Columbia is thrusting into West Harlem as part of a $6bn growth plan. It is hard to walk through cities without coming across construction sites for new college campuses.\nWith the conclusion that:\nPerhaps a better way to regard urban institutions such as UCL is not as multiversities but “citiversities” — the core industry of city states in a globalised world.

Have we been looking at the relationship the wrong way around - do universities help build cities, or do cities cultivate their universities?

Last updated December 2020.\nHere’s my academic writing workflow: it allows me to quickly pull together information from dozens of articles into a structured format that allows new ideas and connections to form. It won’t work for everyone, although there is plenty of scope for customisation.\n1. Pulling everything together # I won’t go into great detail here, but I collect all my research materials together first. For me, this is PDFs of articles, reports, and book chapters. In the past I used version 3 of Papers for Mac, but I have recently switched to Zotero, a powerful open source, cross-platform alternative. I group everything by project into smart folders using tags. Google Scholar is invaluable for sourcing articles (Papers allows you to search Google Scholar and import articles from within the application; Zotero has browser integrations to allow one-click importing).\nExample screenshot of Papers for Mac: note the highlighted PDF\n2. Highlighting and commenting # I now read through everything in rough order of how important I think the article will be. This means later articles can be skim read (when concentration levels are lower) to pick up additional insight or nuance. Whilst reading I highlight relevant paragraphs or sentences – as less is better try to avoid highlighting entire pages – and I add comments with any thoughts or ideas. Papers has this function built in; applications like Skim (open source for Mac) and Highlights (a commercial alternative for Mac and iOS) can also do this, and both play nicely with Zotfile (a Zotero PDF management plugin – great if you’re a fan of keeping everything open source).\nWant a speedier version of this workflow? 💨 Check out how to do quick and dirty literature surveys\n3. Exporting and tagging notes # All highlights are now exported as plain text files – one per article or report, or a single file with all highlights across all readings. The beauty of highlighting in an application like Skim or Papers is the automatic inclusion of page numbers and other bibliographic information in the exported file.\nDepending on the complexity of the project, I may just export all the notes as one giant text file, print this, and start writing. However, in more advanced literature reviews, an extra step is helpful. In this case, I export each reading as an individual file and import these into TAMS Analyzer, an excellent open-source Mac application for qualitative text analysis. Effective use of TAMS Analyzer is a post in itself, but the documentation is fairly solid.\nI then work through my imported highlights, and tag them. Usually this will be within 4-5 headings that will naturally emerge from the initial reading: for a recent review of universities and cities, for example, I had the headings ‘leadership’, ‘international’, ‘regional’, ‘urban’ and ‘conclusions’. Finally, with a couple of clicks, TAMS Analyzer can generate a table with headings at the top, and all of the highlights below – one box per highlight. The source name – drawn from the plain text export of your initial highlights – is appended (usually Author-Year).\nThe great benefit of this extra step is a single file that can easily contain insight and analysis from twenty or thirty articles (or more). Instead of thirty print outs, you have one – admittedly quite big – file with several thematic groupings, each with a mixture of authors and sources. This makes writing much, much easier.\nHTML output from TAMS Analyzer: you can reformat so it\u0026rsquo;s easier to print (and read) 4. Writing # Again, I won’t go into this too much, as most people have their own tools and preferred way of working. I use the fantastic Ulysses for Mac for nearly all of my writing. Citations are easily managed via your research manager, which sorts all the references and bibliographic information once the final text is exported into Word (or LibraOffice). Ulysses integrates well with Papers (more here) by using the Magic Citations tool to insert references as you write (the source name, Author-Year, is in your table from step three). The process can be replicated very smoothly using open source plugins for Zotero by following this excellent workflow.\nI work through the table of notes as I write, often sequentially by thematic heading. This has two main benefits: you’re drawing on notes ordered by theme not author, so you naturally avoid paragraphs with multiple citations from just one source. Second, with excerpts from many sources sitting next to each other in the table, you make new connections between different authors and ideas. Any notes or comments you made on the initial read through are also included.\nPapers\u0026rsquo; Magic Citations tool used in Ulysses\nConcluding comments # This workflow mimics a paper method I used years ago, which took a lot more time (and used a lot more paper). Some may prefer to read from paper copies – I tend to print just the most important articles. Others prefer to write as they read.\nFor those working outside the social sciences this workflow may not work so well – but I’d be interested to test this. It doesn’t work so well with books unless you have a PDF version, although these are often cumbersome. I tend to take separate notes on books in a plain text file to be used in step three.\nLastly, the flow in workflow is important. If you wait too long between the first few stages and stage four (writing) you begin to lose the connections you form when you make the initial highlights. The wider context of selected sentences is lost, and you forget why you highlighted certain sections in the first place.\n(Photo credit)\n","date":"2 February 2018","permalink":"/posts/academic-writing-workflow/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"Did you just land on this site for the first time?","title":"Academic writing workflow: how to read lots as efficiently as possible (2020 edition)"},{"content":"A few weeks ago I was honoured to chair a panel session in Lisbon on city strategies for talent attraction, bringing together speakers from Portugal, Italy and Germany. In my opening remarks I picked three traits of cities that successfully attract talent. Because all three rely on cooperation with universities, these are also the traits of the successful universities of the future:\nUniversities jointly collaborate with the city. Of course, this only applies where there are multiple universities. But where this is the case, institutions work together, speaking to the city with one voice, pooling resources and avoiding multiple bilateral conversations. For some great examples of this, see my recent report looking at how the universities in Toronto have produced joint research projects to benefit the city, have come together to bid for UNESCO City of Culture status, and much more. They reach marginalised communities. Universities and cities work together to spread the benefits of internationalisation to communities that are geographically more distant or otherwise may feel ‘left behind’. My report for the British Council shows how Dublin, Glasgow, Hannover and Amsterdam are working to involve marginalised communities in internationalisation activities. An entrepreneurial use of space. Successful urban universities, when forced (often through limited space) to think creatively when developing new buildings and inner-city spaces, blur the edges between the city and the university. By mixing the two and reimagining public spaces, planners can bring different groups of people together and allow new ideas to spread. Ryerson University, featured in the Toronto report, is a great example (more here). Birmingham City University’s expansion near Curzon Street station is another (more here). The conference was organised by The Class of 2020, a Dutch think tank looking at student living.

A report setting out what we can learn has just been published by KPMG in the UK and is available here. Here’s an intro: Universities are an undervalued force for development. With a presence in nearly every major town and city in the world, they should be at the centre of regional regeneration and international partnership building. But too often they are secondary partners, or used to fill subcommittee seats. However, some universities are leading the way in city-building efforts. They are the city’s superpower – a force for long-term prosperity and local inclusivity. They recognise that if their city is failing, they too will fail. They recognise that a skilled and connected city is a successful city. They are proactive and pragmatic. They recognise their role within the city and the mutual benefit their engagement will bring. They understand how they can help solve societal challenges, and they understand that local engagement complements international relations. Toronto’s universities demonstrate how to excel in individual initiatives, yet come together to benefit the city. This report shows how universities in and around Toronto are using five key superpowers to work with their city and strengthen it:\nUniversities are ‘anchor tenants’, investing in the future and inspiring confidence. They send a message to fellow city residents: we believe in the prosperity of this area. Universities have long-term visions. Looking beyond the cycle of mayoral appointments and provincial elections, universities are a trusted partner for future planning. Universities can be critical yet constructive, outspoken yet objective. They are machines for solving problems and generating ideas, home to highly-concentrated brainpower, and steeped in knowledge and evidence. Universities educate and train the future workforce. They provide the skills to build the city. Universities are a window to the world, framing local issues within international debates, and bringing global discoveries to the city. City-building is powered by universities. The next phase of city-building will see greater autonomy and leadership of individual cities. The challenges cities face will grow in complexity and severity. Universities will need to bring their superpowers and play a role at multiple levels: from developments on campus, to city-wide links, to global relations. Universities need to adapt to work effectively with their city. And as the burden of local and global challenges falls increasingly on cities, and as future prosperity continues to depend on training and retaining the most skilled individuals, city leaders will need to unlock the superpowers of their universities.

Think hospitals needing to serve a growing population, or a university near colleges, industry and other intellectual activity. Yet a new breed of anchor institutions have arrived: born unrooted, they float high and unencumbered by place until they are enticed to a city by an offer they can’t refuse. Two recent examples showcase this. First, Amazon is inviting metropolitan areas in the US to bid to host the company’s second headquarters. The prize?\nAmazon will hire as many as fifty thousand (50,000) new full-time employees with an average annual total compensation exceeding one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) over the next ten to fifteen years, following commencement of operations. The Project is expected to have over $5 billion in capital expenditures.\nAreas are expected to meet strict criteria, including a highly educated workforce and a ‘strong university system’. The Centre for Cities cover the ins and outs of Amazon’s invitation nicely, concluding that ‘firms like Amazon need cities as much as cities need firms like Amazon’. But it appears that Amazon have the upper hand. Second, the UK’s vote for Brexit has effectively booted the European Medicines Agency (EMA) out of London. The EMA’s Canary Wharf headquarters is home to 890 staff and 36,000 annual visitors. EU countries have been bidding to host the EMA, who have also issued a set of criteria for interested parties. Yet, in this case, existing staff have been particularly influential. Reuters reports that\nA staff survey last week found that between 19 and 94 percent of employees were likely to leave after the move, depending on which location was chosen. Picking Amsterdam, Barcelona, Vienna, Milan or Copenhagen as the new headquarters would be the best option for retaining staff, the survey found.\nIn both cases, the more connected, more open, more liveable cities with a skilled, educated population are in a far stronger position to attract a floating anchor institution.

Instead the deal-makers, the tactical masters, and the charismatic will be in demand. In this context, what contribution can a think tank realistically make in the coming year? At the RSA we have been working over the last two years to support the development of a new kind of think tank: one that is focused on the issues of a specific place, within an ‘anchor institution’ that itself shapes the place it is in. Despite over a decade of devolution and localism in UK politics, there are remarkably few1 civil society organisations that have been established with a place as their focus. We hear frequent complaints of policy silos and politics centred on Westminster, yet most think tanks organise themselves around a policy issue and locate themselves in Westminster. To generate a richer debate on the social and economic development of the UK\u0026rsquo;s towns and cities, we need to bridge the gap between the sidelined political philosophy and the daily grind of machine politics. For several years, the RSA has recognised that universities have enormous potential to drive social and economic outcomes in the places they exist - echoing calls for a new breed of \u0026lsquo;civic university\u0026rsquo;. RSA Chief Executive Matthew Taylor gave the keynote speech last week, launching Nottingham Civic Exchange, based at Nottingham Trent University (NTU). In partnership with the university leadership, the RSA has helped shape this civic think tank - bringing together many of our Fellows across the region and pooling our research capabilities. NTU views Nottingham Civic Exchange as a key part of delivering its overall strategy. Going to the heart of what will matter in the lives of one million people across Nottingham and Nottinghamshire, the first programme of Nottingham Civic Exchange is called ‘Out of the Ordinary’. Today, NCE publishes an analysis of ‘ordinary working families’ in the city-region. Rather than simply using economic analysis to fuel Westminster soundbites, and packaging up a new demographic for electoral fodder, this study uncovers important data on Ordinary Working Families in a specific place.\nSix million people define themselves as ‘just about managing’\nWhile the struggles of the ‘squeezed middle’, ‘alarm clock Britain’ and households on low and moderate incomes have been discussed for years, what is most remarkable is that nationwide, an estimated six million people define themselves as ‘just about managing’, despite being in households with income above the national median. In Nottingham, jobs in the caring and leisure industries are more common sources of employment compared to the UK average, and the prevailing low pay of these sectors - where women hold the majority of roles - challenges household finances. The RSA\u0026rsquo;s Inclusive Growth Commission made the case for place-based industrial strategies, which will be even more crucial as the economic adjustment of leaving the EU approaches, and devolution seems likely to stall. NTU has a particular accountability to families who are \u0026lsquo;just about managing\u0026rsquo; - 21% of their 2015 full time undergraduate intake is estimated to come from this background. Through the summer, the RSA’s ongoing work with NCE will bring a further focus on economic insecurity. We think addressing economic security is a neglected policy goal, which will help bring in to focus the following:\nThe breakdown of traditional class markers. University education has expanded for the recent generation, occupational roles in the workplace are undergoing accelerating change, and home ownership is declining among adults in their 30s establishing families. The financial security previously afforded by a university degree and a white-collar job is eroding, and partly as a consequence owner-occupation is less easily accessible as a form of insurance to protect against unstable or falling incomes. As post-election analysis has suggested, ‘age is the new class’ when it comes to predicting how people align to support political parties. The importance of households as a unit of analysis. Most labour market statistics, for example, look at workers as individuals. Most workers live in households and financial decisions are made in that context: 43% of people have a joint account with their partner. Families and their homes transmit wealth through the economy at a scale which dwarfs the government\u0026rsquo;s own system of tax-funded pensions. Differences in the experience of insecurity between generations remain relatively under-explored. The importance of looking across the life-course rather than using snapshot data pictures. Looking at longitudinal data across Europe, the lower middle class has the highest rates of transitory poverty; moving in and out of poverty defines their economic status. The economic, fiscal, social and health impacts of subjective (\u0026lsquo;felt\u0026rsquo;) insecurity are just as, if not more potent than, the effects of objective insecurity and material deprivation. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that addressing material deprivation and poverty should be neglected as policy goals. But it does mean recognising that progressing in the modern workplace brings anxieties and volatility, not necessarily the secure affluence that many crave. Longer-term, a defining characteristic of our era is declining confidence that the future will be better than the past. A survey in 2015 found 25% of UK respondents thought their children would be better off than them; 68% thought they would be worse off. My hypothesis is that in a rich country like the UK, being secure in your economic status matters alongside your absolute affluence. And overall economic inequality matters in part because it exacerbates the experience and perception of insecurity for all in society: greater inequality means there is more to gain and more to lose from a change in their position on the income spectrum. Beyond the day-to-day parliamentary dealmaking, the election aftermath may prove be one in which austerity plans are dialled down, labour market considerations dominate Brexit talks and vote-winning policies for ‘ordinary working families’ are reconsidered. At the very least, facing a broad range of possible futures makes it a good time to be a nimble think tank.\nWe need more people to be more involved in policymaking\nThe next phase of work for Nottingham Civic Exchange will look in more detail at the lives of Ordinary Working Families through research, policy development and working with local communities to identify important issues and come up with recommendations for making changes which have real life impact. They will also link students and staff at the university with wider communities through scholarships, internships, and research projects. In line with the RSA\u0026rsquo;s wider programme on revitalising economic democracy, we need more people to be more involved in policymaking - in this parliament and beyond - if government and society is to successfully address growing economic insecurity for growing numbers of people. Through partnering with a university committed to improving the city and region it calls home, Nottingham Civic Exchange will tighten the links between policy, action and legitimacy in addressing economic insecurity.\nJonathan is Associate Director - Public Services and Communities at the RSA (Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce).

Steven has an excellent YouTube walkthrough guide that I recommend following from start to finish. It takes you through downloading QGIS and installing Natural Earth data to advanced styling and designing animated markers. You build upon a blank map of the world: Which quickly grows in complexity: I needed to create a map showing four specific European cities, and so the map needed refining and tidying. Here’s the final map in QGIS: Which can then be exported at print resolution, or (in this case) exported as a SVG file for editing in a vector graphics programme. This allows the labels to be adjusted and other visual tweaks made. QGIS is a hugely powerful program offering a great deal of customisation.

Cities and universities are hungry for more people. Infrastructural weaknesses - from dodgy travel connections to a lack of quality and affordable housing - can act as bottlenecks to future growth and obstacles to attracting talented people. The issues facing universities are often shared by the city they are in. Many European cities have ambitious growth plans. Some want to revitalise particular districts, others recognise they need another 200,000 people to become truly competitive. Where countries have targets in place to, for example, double the number of international students, cities and universities need to work together to accommodate new arrivals.

From the cacophony of reporting on the consequences of the political events of 2016, three recent perspectives caught my eye. All emphasise the need to better understand the roles of regions and universities.\nCities and bottom-up innovation # Bruce Katz calls for cities and metropolitan areas to power the United States forward under a Trump administration:\nA wide range of policies relating to taxes, trade, the environment, immigration, infrastructure, and health care seem likely to be upended. But some things will stay the same—metropolitan areas will continue to drive our national economy forward, and they will remain the geographies most capable of bridging the partisan divisions that plague our national politics. In both of these respects, local leadership will now be more important than ever… Over the next several years, the hard business of investing in the future and uniting the nation will not be conducted in Washington. Rather it will occur in our localities, where leaders and residents in our cities, suburbs, exurbs, and rural areas will work together to find common ground and purpose.\nUniversities as the main links between nations # Philip Altbach and Hans de Wit look to history:\nWill we see again a de-Europeanization and nationalization of higher education in Europe emerging, in the light of greater criticism of European integration, the growth of nationalist populist movements, and tensions between Russia and western Europe and the United States? Academic cooperation and exchange have been in many cases, including during the Cold War, the main relations between nations: they continued to take place and even were stimulated so as to pave the way for further contacts. We have to learn from these lessons. International higher education is substantially different from earlier historical periods, as well as from the Cold War. Its scope is also different, with increasing political and academic power influences from other regions of the world, especially Asia. But, even though we should be realistic that international cooperation and exchange are not guarantees for peace and mutual understanding, they continue to be essential mechanisms for keeping communication open and dialogue active.\nA resurgence of regional enterprise # An editorial in Regional Studies provides an unusually speculative forecast for an academic journal (the piece is worth reading in full):\nThe implications for cities and regions of the fracturing of the international order are highly uncertain. Resurgent popular nationalism would have profound consequences for all territories by inhibiting foreign direct investment (FDI), external trade and access to scarce skills, and forcing more reliance on local capabilities and domestic production. Some argue that a reversal of globalization would dampen economic progress and suppress opportunities for the world’s poorest places and populations. Alternatively, patriotic impulses that challenge ossified structures and global cartels could provoke a resurgence of regional enterprise and organic growth. Well-conceived policy reforms that disrupt business inertia could engender another Schumpeterian wave of innovation and creativity based on smaller-scale production. Dynamic regional multipliers might be spurred by efforts to localize resource flows so as to secure the supply of food and scarce materials, to cut energy consumption and to regenerate degraded ecosystems. Enhanced democratic constraints on business short-termism may also curb financial speculation and encourage longer-term investment in the real economy. Furthermore, international disengagement might serve to bolster local and regional identities and renew a sense of place and belonging. This could elevate the obligations on civic leaders and rebuild confidence in the role of city and regional institutions. Against this, heightened perceptions of fear and insecurity could foster a ‘new tribalism’ through separatist movements, ethnic tensions, insurgent splinter groups and other inward-looking forces that escalate conflict and pull countries and regions apart. Much depends on whether democratic institutions are capable of responding to the genuine concerns of citizens and can meld different interests and values together in pursuit of shared agendas and collective solutions. Meanwhile, if the Paris climate deal leads to restrictions on fossil fuel extraction in favour of clean energy, this could make many regions reliant on oil, gas and coal reserves vulnerable to stranded assets and obsolete power generation systems. The case for regional studies is accentuated rather than diminished in all these scenarios. Systematic analyses of how different territories are adapting to the unravelling of globalization and introducing more holistic and resilient strategies to cope with the turbulence are urgently needed.\nIn other news, I have written a short piece for KPMG on a new era of university-city partnerships.

The Commission follows in the footsteps of the City Growth Commission, which informed much of the previous government’s policy on cities and devolution. The findings argue that:\nAs a country we need to put social capital on a par with traditional physical infrastructure when we consider how to invest public resources in future growth. That means treating as investment, policies that are designed to bring poorer people and places up to the level where they can contribute equally to economic growth.\nA similar message emerges in the \u0026lsquo;zero draft\u0026rsquo; of the New Urban Agenda that will be set out at the major UN Habitat III conference in Quito next month:\nWe recognize that we must ensure equitable and affordable access to basic physical and social infrastructure for all, including affordable serviced land, housing, energy, water and sanitation, waste disposal, mobility, health, education, and information and communication technologies. We further recognize that provision must be sensitive to the rights and needs of women, children and youth, older persons and persons with disabilities, and other people in vulnerable situations such as refugees, migrants, and displaced persons, removing all legal, institutional, physical, and socio-economic barriers that prevent them from participating equally in urban life and the opportunities it offers.\n(For more on why Habitat III is a big deal, see this excellent piece published on The Conversation.) Many economists and policymakers have long advocated for increased investment in education and other social goods on par with physical infrastructure. The voices of the Inclusive Growth Commission and Habitat III will add weight to these arguments. However, the beneficiaries of investment in social capital also need to speak up at the major conferences and forums. Bodies such as universities and hospitals can make the case for investment in their facilities, and the economic and social returns this generates. They can also position themselves as integral to other parts of the debate where their inclusion is less obvious, such as provision of public space: a strong case can surely be made for investing in open university campuses designed to bring people and ideas together and share knowledge. When I read these sentences in the New Urban Agenda draft, they seem almost written with universities in mind:\nPublic spaces, which consist of open areas such as streets, sidewalks, squares, gardens and parks, must be seen as multi-functional areas for social interaction, economic exchange, and cultural expression among a wide diversity of people and should be designed and managed to ensure human development, building peaceful and democratic societies and promoting cultural diversity.\nPhoto: Panorámica del Centro Histórico de Quito on Flickr\n","date":"29 September 2016","permalink":"/posts/commissions-conferences-and-universities/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"Last week Stephanie Flanders, former BBC economics editor, launched the emerging findings of the RSA Inclusive Growth Commission at the Core Cities summit in London.","title":"Commissions, conferences and the voice of universities"},{"content":"In what now seems like the distant past, before the Brexit vote and the change of government, the House of Commons launched an inquiry looking at the Northern Powerhouse and Midlands Engine and government policy towards regional growth.

The case for simulators # Simulators can be a valuable testing ground. In a fascinating tour through the history of city building games, Richard Moss notes how urban planners used the original SimCity (released 1989) to test existing ideas and inspire new ones:\nPlaying SimCity helped develop our understanding—or mental model, as Will Wright [Sim City\u0026rsquo;s founder] calls it—of the urban environment that so much of the world\u0026rsquo;s population lives in, and it took some of the mystery out of why urban planners make the seemingly bizarre decisions that they do. If you thought you could improve traffic flows by making the roads five times wider and staggering residential blocks with commercial and industrial ones, you could try it and see (spoiler: it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work—traffic always expands to fill road capacity, and such a zoning policy would lower land values and increase pollution). If you believed a nearby rail line was increasing crime in your area, you could model your city in the game and experiment with changes. \u0026hellip;the city builders of tomorrow will likely be all about exploring the future of real-world city design. After all, city builders were always—right from the very beginning—about building a utopia, and our best hope of one day achieving a perfect built environment is to practice in simulations first.1\nModern simulators have become increasingly sophisticated. One city planner has said that SimCity 4\u0026rsquo;s traffic simulator is \u0026lsquo;actually more advanced than what most traffic engineers use in real life\u0026rsquo;. The game has been used to model suburban sprawl.\nShe built more police stations in Providence than probably exist in all of Southeastern New England, swapped out the electric power plant for a nuclear one, and bulldozed the church\nOthers have used simulators as tests of competence for leadership roles. In a great article about the real mayors of SimCity, Jason Koebler tells the story of the 1990 Democratic primary election in Providence, Rhode Island, where a 15 year old freelancer for the local newspaper invited five mayoral candidates to compete against each other in a game of SimCity. One candidate didn\u0026rsquo;t take the test too seriously. She \u0026lsquo;built more police stations in Providence than probably exist in all of Southeastern New England, swapped out the electric power plant for a nuclear one, and bulldozed the church\u0026rsquo;. In a strongly-Catholic area, some felt this lost her the primary. Some fare better. Koebler writes how in 2002 mayoral candidates in Warsaw, Poland played SimCity 3000. Lech Kaczynski won the competition, won the election, and eventually became the president of Poland. So might there be a case for a university simulator? Universities are highly complex and higher education policy is interlinked with wider policies on economic growth, employability, skills, education, cities,2 internationalism and immigration. No two institutions are alike, and some are unrecognisable from one another. But I still think there could be some merit in a university simulator. I don\u0026rsquo;t suggest Sim University would make a good selection exercise for prospective vice chancellors, but we could test new ideas and also understand the complexity of effectively managing a university. I might be the only person who would play it though\u0026hellip; Images from SimCity 4\nHere is an example of a game created by a professor from the University of Southern California School of Architecture that aims to contribute to the discussion about the future of cities. ↩ Incidentally, SimCity 4 confirms the important role universities play in cities. Josh Dzieza in the Daily Beast: \u0026lsquo;Education in SimCity is a sort of wonder drug: if you build a university, people get sick less, commit less crime, build solar panels on their roofs, get wealthier, and are generally better off. They also start to complain more about bad city services and pollution, so depending on what sort of Sim mayor you are it could have drawbacks.\u0026rsquo; ↩ ","date":"9 September 2016","permalink":"/posts/sim-university/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"Introducing the latest instalment in the award-winning Sim franchise: manage your own university!","title":"Sim University"},{"content":"Ghana faces a set of challenges similar to many emerging nations\u0026hellip; # Ghana is an \u0026lsquo;African Lion\u0026rsquo;: a fast-growing economy, falling levels of vulnerable employment and rising productive employment led to Ghana becoming a lower-middle income country in 2007.

Urban strategies stress the \u0026lsquo;very limited timeframe to avoid unplanned sprawl and transform Ningo-Prampram into a thriving and prosperous compact, connected, socially inclusive and resilient city, which would be a sustainable development example for the country of Ghana and for the region as a whole\u0026rsquo;.

Two basic facts - too heavy a concentration in the “Seoul capital region” and a very limited degree of political decentralization - have aggravated the disparities across regions in Korea for a long time\u0026hellip; the Seoul capital region, only 11.8% of the South Korea’s total areas, accommodates 46% of the population, 57% of all manufacturing firms, about 70% of enrolled university students, 2/3 of financial activities.\nIn the mid-2000s the South Korean government prioritised decentralisation and balanced development as a national priority, but, unlike previous governments, saw this \u0026lsquo;as a means to strengthening the competitiveness of the country as a whole\u0026rsquo;.2 Yong-Sook Lee, an academic at Korea University, explains how balanced national development was encouraged through innovation:\n\u0026hellip;the PCBND [Presidential Committee on Balanced National Development] set up 14 regional innovation councils with 725 commissioners across the country\u0026hellip; These councils were designed to encourage local initiatives in creating and implementing regional policy. To achieve self-sustaining endogenous development, the PCBND pursued a Nuri [New University for Regional Innovation] project that nurtures local talent by supporting local universities. In 2004, the government allocated a five year grant of 1.4 trillion won [about £900m at today\u0026rsquo;s rate] for cultivating local talent in promoting regional strategic industries. In 2006, a grant of 260 billion won [£170m] was awarded to 109 local universities in non-capital regions\u0026hellip; Furthermore, the PCBND placed emphasis on reinforcing networks between local universities and local industries for the purpose of boosting R\u0026amp;D activities in non-capital regions.\nUniversities seem to play a particularly prominent role in South Korea. Kim expands on the New University for Regional Innovation concept:\nNURI promotes “competition” within respective provincial regions by concentrating financial support on excellent projects selected in each region. It is worth noting that local universities form the project headquarters in NURI programs. They should include in their project teams other regional innovation actors such as other interlinked universities, research institutes, local authorities, business firms, or NGOs. This way, the principal universities serve to build and expand innovative networks between business, academia, public authorities, and other related actors.\nArguably, business is underrepresented. Here is the composition of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Regional Innovation Council in 2006, where universities are nearly a quarter of members but business less than 10 percent:\nCategory\nNumber of councillors\nLocal/regional authorities (including civil services)\n23\nResearch institutes\n7\nCivil society (including NGOs)\n19\nUniversities\n24\nBusiness\n9\nPress\n6\nInnovation supporting agencies\n12\nTotal\n100\nKim concludes that \u0026rsquo;the emergence of regions as an autonomous and important actor in the development of the country is quite a remarkable progress in Korean society\u0026rsquo;. However, \u0026lsquo;Korea is lagging behind in that it lacks “regional experimentalism” found in Europe\u0026rsquo;, mainly due to a lack of \u0026lsquo;sufficient autonomy and independent resources despite the participatory government’s emphasis on bottom-up approach\u0026rsquo;. Whilst universities have been instrumental to South Korean attempts at rebalancing, genuine autonomy, devolved resources and partnership between important local actors are required for regions to be strengthened. It would be valuable to see progress in the ten years since the two academic articles referenced here.\nThis blog is in three parts.

The complementary economic roles of Busan’s seaport and Daegu’s manufacturing expertise have also been significantly supported\u0026rsquo;. ↩ Previous administrations tried to rebalance the economy by many means, including applying brakes on Seoul\u0026rsquo;s development by restricting the expansion of universities, factories, shops and other development that might attract migrants.

These deals cover 16.1 million people mostly in larger urban areas. The highest profile devolution has been within the so-called Northern Powerhouse, with Manchester as its unofficial capital. The relative leadership strength of Manchester and history of close cooperation between its constituent local authorities has allowed it to forge a path that others outside London will struggle to emulate. The driving concept behind the Northern Powerhouse is agglomeration. Devolution without agglomeration is certainly possible, but the sum-greater-than-the-parts benefits that arise from close proximity of workers, firms and education bodies mean truly effective devolution must be underpinned by agglomeration. Think of it as Devolution + Agglomeration Economics = Growth and a Knowledge-Based Economy. The two highest profile agglomeration projects in England - the Northern Powerhouse and the Midlands Engine - have 50 universities between them. Higher education, as a knowledge industry, contributes to the agglomeration economies that drive city growth. This is evident in London, with over 40 higher education institutions. Other areas in line for devolution deals will often have at least one university on their patch. Here are four ways universities can help.\nIf devolved areas are to be functional economic actors, there will need to be effective coordination between the different towns, cities and local authorities within the area. Universities can help. They have long-standing networks between and within regions. Universities have a long history of supporting local areas with analysis of needs and assets, and providing of evidence and policy insight. This will continue with Science and Innovation Audits that will help to map local research, innovation and infrastructure strengths and uncover opportunities for businesses.\nLocally-built international links will be important. Universities can draw on their global alumni and international research networks. Universities attract overseas students but also foreign direct investment. When considering regional investment in the UK, the skills of the local workforce and transport infrastructure are the key factors that influence decisions.\nAgglomeration economics can be seen in practice within universities. Many university campuses are public spaces, providing community services and cultural events, and the line between the public realm and the university estate is softening. Universities are ideal hosts for the human face-to-face connections that spread new ideas and knowledge. They often house incubation centres for startups and social enterprises, work with SMEs, and generate cutting edge research.\nUniversities can meet local skills needs. There is a strong correlation between cities with more skills and higher levels of human capital, and local employment growth.1 The majority of future growth and the rebalancing of the economy will rely on knowledge based industries which are dependent on high level skills.\nRecognising that devolution is a journey rather than a destination, universities should provide a long-term vision and help local partners to overcome the challenges and recognise the opportunities that come with devolved powers.\nThis blog is in three parts.

The Northern Powerhouse was a mainstay of the Cameron government, and closely linked to George Osborne. The Northern Powerhouse concept is underpinned by agglomeration - the idea that the concentration of people, businesses and education establishments in close proximity leads to new knowledge, transfer of new ideas and greater productivity. It\u0026rsquo;s a really good idea. I talked about it (under the guise of proximity) here. There\u0026rsquo;s plenty of academic work on agglomeration economies and clustering effects, and it is the driving force behind many of the City Growth Commission\u0026rsquo;s final recommendations. But is the Northern Powerhouse still alive? On 27 July Northern Powerhouse minister Andrew Percy and Treasury commercial secretary Lord O’Neill reaffirmed the government’s commitment to building a Northern Powerhouse. (Lord O’Neill had previously threatened to quit if the Northern Powerhouse dies. A few weeks later he threatened to quit again, this time over the UK\u0026rsquo;s approach to China. He\u0026rsquo;s not having a good month.) However, Theresa May hasn\u0026rsquo;t mentioned the words Northern Powerhouse since assuming office. Her Economy and Industrial Strategy Cabinet Committee met for the first time on 2 August 2016 - the press release doesn\u0026rsquo;t mention the Northern Powerhouse either, but quotes May: we \u0026rsquo;need a plan to drive growth up and down the country, from rural areas to our great cities’. Many commentators have picked up on this - perhaps previous plans were too Manchester-centric, or the government needs to appease voters in large swathes of the country that voted to leave the EU, or the plans were too closely associated with the former chancellor. A broader focus seems inevitable. At the same time, Andy Burnham used his nomination as Labour candidate for Manchester mayor to campaign for the resurrection of the Northern Powerhouse - a curious case of a Labour politician pushing a Conservative policy. However, as Alexandra Jones notes on the Centre for Cities blog, a likely outcome is that work on the Northern Powerhouse continues, but the name might be quietly dropped. We may well see a more diverse range of future devolution deals, including for the first time some in the south of England, and a softening of the requirement for elected mayors. It will be difficult to do, but encouraging effective agglomeration more widely is a good move.\nThis blog is in three parts. Tomorrow we\u0026rsquo;ll look at how universities can help realise the benefits of agglomeration. And next week we\u0026rsquo;ll look at an international example of agglomeration economics in action.\nPhoto: \u0026lsquo;Salford Quay Apartments\u0026rsquo; on Flickr\n","date":"11 August 2016","permalink":"/posts/is-the-northern-powerhouse-dead/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"The past few weeks have been full of speculation as to the future of the Northern Powerhouse, the plan to create strong links between urban areas in northern England.","title":"Is the Northern Powerhouse dead?"},{"content":"India wants 100 of them. China had 193 pilots of these running in 2013. At the moment they are largely conceptual, little known by the average person on the street, mostly \u0026lsquo;captured\u0026rsquo; by commercial interests, and, as I\u0026rsquo;ve written about before, we are still some way from realising their transformative potential. But smart city initiatives will be an important part of future city development. Universities can help shift smart cities from being merely a good idea to providing everyday benefit to citizens. They can do this through smart campuses - developing the principles of smart cities on a limited geographic area, testing new infrastructure and implementing lessons learned, drawing in students and researchers, and then working with city officials to roll these out more widely. The University of Glasgow is expanding its campus by 25% over ten years. The university is working with the Future Cities Catapult on a project to \u0026lsquo;develop a strategy for a Smart Campus that will take into account changes in technology and learning whilst also protecting their heritage (both cultural and physical) and realising cost savings\u0026rsquo;. The Catapult has developed a definition of the smart campus that supports the university’s new strategy:\nThe Smart Campus actively learns from and adapts to the needs of its people and place, unlocking the potential of e technology and enabling world-changing learning and research.\nOther universities have been working on smart campus projects. The University of Nottingham plans to develop a smart campus that is ‘efficient, safe, sustainable, responsive and enjoyable place to live and work, underpinned and enhanced by digital / internet based technologies’. They see the campus as ‘an ideal vehicle’ for researching, developing and evaluating a ‘diversity’ of smart city concepts, especially as the university is multi-site and encircles a major hospital. The project has attracted the interest of Nottingham City Council. A case study of the University of Lille presented to the World Bank in 2014 applies elements of smart cities – smart sensors, smart data analysis – to a university campus based in a city. The angle of this presentation seems to suggest the campus could act as a city in microcosm and thus be a good test case for wider implementation, for example managing water, energy and transport on campus. There would also be other benefits to embedding ‘smart’ on a campus: immediate access to expertise and researchers, reinforcing partnerships with local government and with the private sector, and capturing learning in new education programmes that could be delivered to students alongside implementation on campus. Developing a smart campus is arguably easier than developing smart city, with most of the campus falling under the ownership of one institution. In essence, the presentation concludes, the smart campus could ‘promote the concept of smart city to the city’.\n# Lessons # It\u0026rsquo;s important to prepare students and staff (the campus equivalent of a city\u0026rsquo;s residents) for smart campuses. After analysing the experiences of smart cities around the world, Nesta have found that many ‘top down’ smart city ideas have failed to deliver on their promise, and that smart city planners need to take human behaviour as seriously as technology, and to invest in smart people, as well as smart technology.\nBy blurring the public realm and the university estate, city residents can become involved in the development of smart cities\nLocal government and city leaders may be keen to test the concept of a smart city by supporting the development of a smart campus. By seeing campuses as ‘cities in microcosm’ the development of smart infrastructure can lead to closer working between universities and local leaders. And by softening the edges between a campus and a city, by opening up campuses as public spaces, providing community services and cultural events, by blurring the public realm and the university estate, other city residents can become involved in the development of smart cities. At the same time, universities can learn from the experience of smart cities. For example, whilst technology is an important component that underpins smart cities and campuses, they need to be developed with people at their core. Universities are ideally placed to both apply the lessons from smart cities in the development of smart campuses, and to ‘test’ smart infrastructure that can be rolled out to smart cities.\n","date":"1 August 2016","permalink":"/posts/smart-campuses/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"India wants 100 of them.","title":"University campuses can be a testbed for smart cities"},{"content":"A recurring theme of this blog is how cities, rather than nations, will be on the front line tackling global challenges in the future. I was fortunate to attend the European Social Services Conference in The Hague last week. The headline was \u0026lsquo;The future is local!\u0026rsquo; and the event explored how public services can collaborate more effectively with local communities and their citizens in combatting poverty and social exclusion. One of the headline speakers was Ahmed Aboutaleb, Mayor of Rotterdam. Across the world mayors are on the rise, not least in the UK with a recent raft of devolution deals including directly elected mayors for cities and regions, and likely to provide an alternate route to power for ambitious politicians.\nUniversities and colleges are included as partners for delivery, sources of expertise, and opportunities for sharing knowledge\nMayor Aboutaleb talked of the need to strengthen regional government, and of the opportunities higher education could provide for lifting the next generation out of poverty. I took the opportunity to visit Rotterdam, and it provides a good example of a city on the front line, gearing up to tackle large-scale problems. With 80% of the city below sea level and one of the largest ports in the world, Rotterdam is especially susceptible to climate change and has an ambition to become 100% climate-proof by 2025. The city\u0026rsquo;s adaptation strategy presents climate change as an opportunity for growth through developing smart solutions and making the city a more attractive place to live and work - and I found Rotterdam to already be an exceptionally well-designed city. Universities and further education colleges are included as partners for delivery, sources of expertise, and opportunities for sharing knowledge to other areas. Unsurprisingly, Rotterdam is also one of the 100 resilient cities (see my earlier post on resilience). Rotterdam is a good example of a city with an effective mayor, backed by a wide range of partners, tackling international challenges. The self-styled Global Parliament of Mayors will have its inaugural meeting in The Hague (which is clearly the place to be) in September 2016, bringing together 125 cities - \u0026rsquo;large and small, from North and South, developed and emerging\u0026rsquo;. The group has the explicit purpose of crafting solutions to challenges, although, as a semi-critical Guardian writer notes, \u0026lsquo;what they might really be interested in is a global parliament of cities, rather than mayors, and that idea – a networked, global assembly of citydwellers, sharing hard-won insights into what works and what generally does not – strikes me as a far better plan\u0026rsquo;. Mayors are on the rise, but an effective mayor will need to be backed by a wide partnership inside and beyond the city.

We argued that the education sector should be placed at the centre of national disaster risk reduction initiatives – not only is the maintenance of education during disasters a form of preserving ‘normality’ in times of crisis, but even small lapses in primary education can have long-term detrimental effects on individuals and society. And education itself can reduce a community’s vulnerability to disaster. Resilience in the education sector meant bringing the right people together, and ensuring they knew their roles and the roles of others in times of emergency. Specifically, that they would know what to do internally within the Ministry and externally with Departments of Education and Training at the local level in the area of disaster preparedness, response and recovery. Resilient cities # I\u0026rsquo;ve been following with interest the 100 resilient cities programme, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and \u0026lsquo;dedicated to helping cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century\u0026rsquo;. Each of the 100 cities appoints a Chief Resilience Officer as part of the programme. Just as the emphasis in the education sector in Vietnam was effective communication and liaison, one of the key tasks of the Chief Resilience Officer will be to work across government departments to help a city improve internal communications, and to bring together a wide array of stakeholders to learn about the city’s challenges. Universities should be active partners in the work of each of the 100 resilient cities. They often already have a good understanding of the complex systems that make up a city, already work with communities, businesses and other parts of the education system, and provide evidence and analysis on city assets and needs. Perhaps the greatest reason for universities contributing to resilience planning would be their long-term presence in cities - in some cases universities were founded hundreds of years ago, and they often plan decades ahead. As Michael Berkowitz, the president of the programme, said in an interview with the Guardian:\nThe ultimate change we’re trying to see in cities – more cohesive communities, better infrastructure, more integrated planning, better mobility – these are things that happen over a generation, not just a couple of years. So one of the questions we’re asking now is how do you keep partnering with cities over an entire generation? Not just to 2020 but 2030, because that’s when we’ll see the kinds of change we’re really looking for.\nPhotos: \u0026lsquo;Vietnam // Việt Nam\u0026rsquo; by lab604\n","date":"18 June 2016","permalink":"/posts/resilient-cities/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"Whilst working for UNESCO in Vietnam we hosted a training programme for senior Ministry of Education and Training staff on disaster risk reduction, looking at the role of policy makers in times of crisis.","title":"Resilient cities, resilient sectors"},{"content":"The central paradox of the modern metropolis is that \u0026lsquo;proximity has become ever more valuable as the cost of connecting across long distance has fallen\u0026rsquo;, writes Ed Glaeser in Triumph of the City. Proximity means people, businesses and universities are packed closely together, enabling new ideas to grow, knowledge to spread and innovation to flourish. Although video conferencing may be free, ideas spread better face-to-face. The growth of knowledge allows the city to triumph. This thinking isn\u0026rsquo;t new. In 1890 Alfred Marshall wrote:\nWhen an industry has thus chosen a locality for itself, it is likely to stay there long: so great are the advantages which people following the same skilled trade get from near neighbourhood to one another. The mysteries of the trade become no mysteries; but are as it were in the air, and children learn many of them unconsciously. Good work is rightly appreciated, inventions and improvements in machinery, in processes and the general organization of the business have their merits promptly discussed: if one man starts a new idea, it is taken up by others and combined with suggestions of their own; and thus it becomes the source of further new ideas.\nHowever, this is not to say that connectivity isn\u0026rsquo;t important: connectivity is vital for cities.1 Dense, local knowledge economies need to be connected to global markets; they need to be, returning to Gleaser\u0026rsquo;s analysis, \u0026lsquo;conduits for knowledge\u0026rsquo;. For example, Bangalore is an \u0026lsquo;urban education hub\u0026rsquo;, a concentration of IT firms and thousands of skilled workers, and a conduit for knowledge through the co-location of local and international businesses. In a virtuous cycle, the proximity of skilled workers and knowledge firms in turn increases the city\u0026rsquo;s attractiveness to international businesses and its connectivity.\nConnected universities # Higher education underpins these knowledge economies through research, education and training, and providing a space for innovation and creativity. But how important is it for universities themselves to be connected?\nUniversities can help improve their locality, but also transcend it\nUniversities are ideally positioned to bridge local, national and international. With their local roots (and many universities were founded to serve their community) and their wider institutional, research and alumni networks, universities can help improve their locality, but also transcend it to help connect their locality to the wider world. And just as isolated cities will struggle to attract skilled workers and international businesses and find it difficult to develop a knowledge-based economy, those universities that aren\u0026rsquo;t connected will struggle to become conduits of knowledge.2\n# Measuring connectivity # I was interested to read that the two largest falls in the 2016 Universitas 21 ranking of national higher education systems were Canada, down three places to ninth, and Bulgaria, down five places to 48th, due mainly to a \u0026lsquo;fall in ranking on connectivity\u0026rsquo;. The methodology defines connectivity as \u0026rsquo;the two-way flow of information between the higher education sector and the rest of society\u0026rsquo;. A closer look shows that Canada actually performed quite well on this measure (top ranked for connectivity are Switzerland, Denmark, Austria, the United Kingdom and Belgium) but Sweden and Hungary fell. There are six measures for connectivity:\nProportion of international students in tertiary education, 2013. Proportion of articles co-authored with international collaborators, 2013. Number of open access full text files on the web, per head of population, July 2015. External links that university web domains receive from third parties, per head of population, 2015. Responses to question ‘Knowledge transfer is highly developed between companies and universities’, asked of business executives in the annual survey by IMD World Development Centre, Switzerland, 2015. Percentage of university research publications that are co-authored with industry researchers, 2011-13. In a future post I will brainstorm a wider range of possible connectivity measures. For example, these measures don\u0026rsquo;t capture connections between city governments and universities. These don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily need to be international; good connectivity means smaller cities are well linked to their larger neighbours. UN Habitat\u0026rsquo;s 2016 World Cities Report notes that:\nThe only certainty about the next few decades is that… uncertainty and risk will become permanent features of society and governance, and this Report argues in favour of “a city that plans,” as opposed to a planned city. Consequently, institutions must also be endowed with the capacity to learn and adapt on a continuous basis. This requires pro-active investment in dynamic regional innovation systems, ideally buttressed by effective metropolitan authorities. If they are, as required, to promote resource-efficient built environments and underlying infrastructures, local governments must support regional innovation systems that connect “green” businesses, universities, think-tanks, social movements, social entrepreneurs and State-owned enterprises. Where these are in short supply locally, agreements can be made with larger urban centres in the country or in other parts of the world. (p.119)\nOften universities are at the centre of knowledge economies, or innovation districts. Their exact location is important, yet so are their wider connections. Well-connected cities will often have well-connected universities at their core, and a well-connected university will support - and be supported by - a connected city. For universities, as with cities, proximity does count, but so does connectivity. Photo Credit: Bangalore Junctions by Scalino via Compfight cc\nAnd growing in importance. In a book about connected cities, Parag Khanna writes that \u0026lsquo;connectivity is destiny\u0026rsquo;. \u0026lsquo;Diplomacy among cities is the return of an ancient pattern. But it also dis-intermediates state structures. Cities building physical and institutional connectivity among each other, as well as growing demographic and economic power, is how they become the drivers of this new system\u0026rsquo;. (See also, \u0026lsquo;are interregional relations the new international relations?\u0026rsquo;) ↩ I would stress that a connected university does not necessarily equal a research-intensive university.

The diplomats of the future will represent cities. That, at least, is my hypothesis based on two trends:\nThe focus on cities as emerging units of governance, taking on the problem-solving responsibilities traditionally held by nations. I\u0026rsquo;ve written about this before (for example here). The focus on cities is due to more than population growth and new buildings, which we often associate with the term urbanisation. Yes, cities are growing. But they are also political actors and centres of ideas and innovation.\nThe need for these cities to work with each other. I\u0026rsquo;ve written about this here. Agglomeration economics are not new - the northeast megalopolis in the US is a prime example - but relations also need to stretch beyond individual clusters.\nSimilarly, there has been quite a lot of attention paid recently to universities and place, but not so much on how universities work with other universities and partners across and between places, and the connecting role they have between local, national and international. The focus on cities and their connections magnifies the importance of universities in cities, and the connections they can help broker. Two recent articles in Times Higher Education mirror this. The first frames universities as problem solvers. Michael Crow writes:\n\u0026hellip;universities should take responsibility for the betterment of society; that we can and should be measured by the impact that we have on the public good\u0026hellip; Education should move beyond singular academic disciplines as the point of focus and towards multidisciplinary programmes and schools capable of understanding and solving complicated real-world problems.\nSecond, Clare Melhuish references historian Thomas Bender, who\nhas compared urban universities to immigrant neighbourhoods in US cities, where residents live in both local place and in a trans-local, diasporic culture at the same time – grounded, while globally connected. From this perspective, universities need to develop a long-term view of how they nurture and evolve those everyday interactions.\nIn a recent post I asked what might happen if we were to frame development in terms of cities (and the towns in their orbit and the spaces that separate them) rather than nations. Here are four initial thoughts:\nNetworks of cities (such as this one or this one) will greatly increase in importance. Most people would struggle to name a group that brings together city or regional leaders, but there are countless well-known examples of gatherings for heads of state. I think international networks of cities are in their infancy and will greatly grow in profile and influence.\nSimilarly, bilateral relationships between cities and regions become more significant. There is growing evidence of this. To take an example of relationships between British and Chinese cities: earlier this month a Confucius Institute opened at Coventry University, a new collaboration between the university and a longstanding partner - Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics (JUFE) in Nanchang. And there are already smart city collaborations between Bristol and Guangzhou, and between Manchester and Wuhan.\nFreed from the constraints of nations, we start to think about groups of people. For example, the pioneering work of Andy Sumner found that 72% of the world\u0026rsquo;s poorest people live in middle income rather than low income countries (in particular India). In part this work helped increase the focus on inequality and highlighted that poverty is often a distribution problem between regions in countries rather than an international distribution problem.\nDevelopment issues don\u0026rsquo;t conform to nation states. Simon Maxwell, the former director of the UK-based Overseas Development Institute, recently gave a speech exploring development agency choices in a new landscape. Reflecting on the shrinking number of low-income countries, he talks about development agencies focusing less on specific \u0026rsquo;target\u0026rsquo; countries (except, perhaps, the small group of \u0026lsquo;fragile\u0026rsquo; states) and more on the \u0026rsquo;essential building blocks\u0026rsquo; of global public goods. These include preventing the emergence and spread of infectious disease, tackling climate change, enhancing international financial stability, strengthening the international trading system, achieving peace and security, and generating knowledge - all challenges that cross borders and require extensive cooperation. He concludes:\nthe emphasis on global public goods suggests turning an old mantra on its head: not ‘think global, act local’, but ‘think local, act global’.\nUniversities already have strong links across regions, and in particular international links that aren\u0026rsquo;t solely between one capital city and another. They link between the important second-tier cities that are often growing faster and are more innovative, but have a lower profile. They draw on alumni, research, staff and institutional relationships. They think local and act global. They can play an important role in facilitating new regional connections.

One of the many valuable lessons to draw from such work is the importance of taking a long term view:\n\u0026hellip;history brings a particular kind of perspective to development problems - it is a vantage point for framing and viewing the nature of development which is relatively long term and comparative, while also paying full attention to, and not shying away from, critical issues of power, contestation and conflict. (p.16)\nIn policy both the medium and long term views are often sacrificed in favour of the short term, for example the apparent willingness to erase the institutional memory on higher education within government. Although this rarely results in colossal blunders, it clearly hinders effective learning and can engender cynicism in those on the receiving end. At the other end of the spectrum, it is an interesting exercise to free ourselves from the short and medium term and think ultra long term. For example, this piece argues that ‘megacities, not nations, are the world’s dominant, enduring social structures\u0026rsquo;, and that cities have outlasted all ‘empires and nations over which they have presided\u0026rsquo;. If we were to frame development in terms of cities (and the towns in their orbit and the spaces that separate them) rather than nations, how would this affect policy? And would, for example, universities in those cities change their strategies? (I\u0026rsquo;ll look at this next week). We should welcome historians into policymaking. The excellent History \u0026amp; Policy site attempts to do just that. An essay from 2010 on \u0026lsquo;The ‘Idea of a University’ today\u0026rsquo; concludes:\nIf we seek guidance from the past, it is better to see the \u0026lsquo;idea of the university\u0026rsquo; not as a fixed set of characteristics, but as a set of tensions, permanently present, but resolved differently according to time and place. Tensions between teaching and research, and between autonomy and accountability, most obviously. But also between universities\u0026rsquo; membership of an international scholarly community, and their role in shaping national cultures and forming national identity; between the transmission of established knowledge, and the search for original truth; between the inevitable connection of universities with the state and the centres of economic and social power, and the need to maintain critical distance; between reproducing the existing occupational structure, and renewing it from below by promoting social mobility; between serving the economy, and providing a space free from immediate utilitarian pressures; between teaching as the encouragement of open and critical attitudes, and society\u0026rsquo;s expectation that universities will impart qualifications and skills. To come down too heavily on one side of these balances will usually mean that the aims of the university are being simplified and distorted.\nPhoto Credit: roomman via Compfight cc\n","date":"13 May 2016","permalink":"/posts/history-policy-and-development/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"Having studied both history and international development, I\u0026rsquo;m always interested in work that bridges the two.","title":"History, policy and development"},{"content":" A new “Russell Group type” alliance of the top universities in Africa will bring together 15 universities from 8 countries.

It\u0026rsquo;s good to see a recommendation to integrate local universities into city leadership, and to use universities as part of a wide knowledge base for informing leadership (page 37):\nCity networks can enhance learning as cities work together, as can partnerships with universities and think tanks. Some workshop participants citied a growing involvement and contribution from universities in their work, while others felt that cities were often “missing a trick” where universities were concerned. This “trick” might be a critical way for city leaders to leverage local resources to increase their knowledge and hence their capacity. Universities can serve as independent and neutral partners, providing academic rigour to the evidence used to inform policy and programme development. Long-term collaborations (as opposed to individual projects) that involve joint working and co-production of knowledge in particular can bring substantial benefits to cities.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re doing work on this at Universities UK in light of devolution, and feeding into House of Commons inquires such as this one looking at the Northern Powerhouse and Midlands Engine. Leadership is important both within and across cities, especially in new geographies that aim to create \u0026lsquo;systems of cities\u0026rsquo;.\nLearning Circle: peer-to-peer education # Image: A bad example of Eliza the chatbot A Pearson/UCL Institute of Education paper makes the case for taking artificial intelligence in education more seriously. We\u0026rsquo;ve had realistic psychotherapists since the 1960s, today chatbots are about to take off, and in the near future automation and machine learning offer huge potential rewards to those who can capitalise on them. Chatbots in education are highly unlikely to replace lecturers any time soon. But a bot you could add on WhatsApp that you can ask to reserve a book in the library, or book a room for group study, or advise on research resources, or provide basic pastoral support, or request transcripts is certainly possible today. I also wonder what the education equivalent of a Funding Circle or a Ratesetter might look like. These FinTech services bypass banks and allow individuals to lend money at a higher interest rate and others to borrow money at a lower rate than at banks, by mediating between the two and taking a small cut in the middle. A higher education equivalent would bypass the institution and allow lecturers to teach small groups directly - the opposite end of the scale to MOOCs. Ultimately, however, you\u0026rsquo;d still face the same issues as MOOCs in terms of accreditation, and lose the many benefits of studying at university.

In higher education it\u0026rsquo;s called graduate retention. In the UK difficulties in retaining graduates in most cities outside of London is an obstacle to rebalancing the economy - a recent study found 15 graduates leave Yorkshire for London for every one moving the other way. In development-speak, brain drain from one country to another is traditionally seen as leading to a \u0026lsquo;human capital\u0026rsquo; deficit in the migrant’s home country. In some cases, an exodus of skilled workers has been encouraged. Devash Kapur explains how Zimbabwe, under the leadership of Robert Mugabe, has encouraged migration of \u0026lsquo;disgruntled groups\u0026rsquo; to maintain authoritarian rule. Much of the Zimbabwean middle class, having the financial means to migrate, has fled to South Africa. Such migration benefits Mugabe, who maintains power and minimises opposition, whilst Zimbabwe receives remittances from the diaspora in South Africa, and South Africa benefits from skilled workers (in particular demand as many highly trained South Africans in turn have emigrated elsewhere). Others such as Easterly and Nyarko argue that there could be some upsides to brain drain. A few examples:\nThe migrants themselves are better off, by revealed preference since migration is voluntary. The migrants may send remittances back to boost the incomes of those left behind. The migrants may have a positive effect on politics or institutions from abroad. The migrants may facilitate trading networks that increase source-country exports to the destination country.\nI admire work that challenges conventional thinking, and I think most of this analysis holds up at both the level of the individual, and at a macro or national level. What\u0026rsquo;s missing is the gap in-between: the impact on those places beyond the capital city, the \u0026lsquo;second tier\u0026rsquo; cities, the towns and rural areas who lose their skilled workers and human capital. The retention of skilled workers in towns and cities outside the capital allows these places to become sustainable generators of their own human capital, training and educating the next generation who will work and study there, and in turn help that place to grow and to prosper. It\u0026rsquo;s a virtuous cycle. Another argument worth exploring from Easterly and Nyarko is this one:\nThe migrants may return home permanently or temporarily, bringing back technology.\nIf we substitute \u0026rsquo;technology\u0026rsquo; for \u0026lsquo;skills\u0026rsquo; (and other assets like networks and experience of other systems and cultures), similar arguments are made for higher education in the UK. Graduates move to London for their first job after graduating, but return to their home town - perhaps to start a family, or buy a house - for their second, third or fourth job. The graduates return more \u0026lsquo;valuable\u0026rsquo; than they left, and the town benefits. Similarly, students studying abroad will return to opportunities at home, as seen in Asia. There is a \u0026lsquo;boomerang\u0026rsquo; effect, with short-term investments giving medium-term returns. There\u0026rsquo;s been some recent work on the role universities can play in retaining skilled graduates, and to help areas retain the skills and knowledge that are needed locally. About 18 months ago the City Growth Commission looked at the role of universities in \u0026lsquo;metro areas\u0026rsquo;. One recommendation proposed \u0026lsquo;golden handcuffs\u0026rsquo; to retain graduates through monetary or other incentives. Another - and I think more promising - recommendation was to establish a graduate clearing scheme to funnel good-but-unsuccessful job applications to large graduate recruiters towards small enterprises. And last month, the Government Office for Science looked at graduate mobility, drawing on five case studies of excellent work by universities fostering entrepreneurship, matching supply and demand, working with SMEs, and using data to improve retention. Ultimately, efforts to improve retention or to attract skilled people from elsewhere will fail if the place itself isn\u0026rsquo;t an attractive destination to live and work. Universities clearly play a role here too. Work by KPMG describes \u0026lsquo;Magnet Cities\u0026rsquo; that attract the young wealth creators of tomorrow, and in turn create an air of energy and excitement about a place. Several of the examples highlight the role of universities. The Government Office for Science report above talks about the importance of \u0026lsquo;place attractiveness\u0026rsquo;. A recent book, \u0026lsquo;The Smartest Places on Earth\u0026rsquo;, argues that depleted industrial centres in the US and Europe are reinventing themselves, with the help of universities, as innovation centres that can solve the problems of the future. Migration is, of course, highly complex, with large cities also suffering from talent deficits in particular areas, masked by overall trends in movement. In London, creative experts are leaving for more affordable cities. Some commentators encourage the term ‘brain circulation’ to reflect this. Perhaps, above all else, mobility should be prioritised - it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t matter whether a graduate remains in his or her town after graduating, but rather that the town attracts those people with the skills needed for its development, regardless of where they are from.\n","date":"30 April 2016","permalink":"/posts/brain-drain-and-mobile-talent/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"Development practitioners call it brain drain.","title":"Brain drain and mobile talent: where international development and higher education overlap"},{"content":"When the Grand Central shopping centre in Birmingham opened alongside a redeveloped New Street Station in September 2015, a fair amount of the fanfare was directed towards John Lewis, the \u0026lsquo;anchor tenant\u0026rsquo; in the development. The Birmingham Mail described 2015 as the year that changed Birmingham forever and highlighted the arrival of the store. And John Lewis themselves were quick to capitalise on the attention focused on the city\u0026rsquo;s regeneration, commissioning \u0026rsquo;the largest panoramic photograph ever taken of the city\u0026rsquo;s changing skyline\u0026rsquo; (it\u0026rsquo;s worth a look). Anchor tenants are highly prized in retail - they bring prestige and draw in crowds, who often spend money in other shops and restaurants in the area. They encourage other shops and businesses to move in to the area. They invest heavily, are large employers and are there for the long-term. In return they may pay lower rent than surrounding shops. There are strong parallels between anchor tenants in retail and the role of universities as anchor institutions in cities. Here, I pick out a few examples of universities who closely resemble \u0026lsquo;anchor tenants\u0026rsquo; - investing heavily in the area and becoming a core part of the identity of the city, and in turn shape its character. They are all significant economic actors, employing large numbers of people and tying their future to that of the area and the people that will visit, study and live in it. There are two key themes: the long-term nature of the anchor role, and the immediate co-location with either government, the public sector, or significant transport and infrastructure hubs. 1. Dublin, Ireland Trinity College Dublin (red) sits next to the Irish Houses of Parliament (blue). On the other side of the campus sit the National Library and the National Gallery. For a member of parliament to speak to an academic, or a student to sit in on a debate, they simply need to cross College Green. 2. Helsinki, Finland The main university building (red) sits to one side of Senate Square. Opposite is the Prime Minister\u0026rsquo;s Office (blue), and overlooking the square and visible from sea is Helsinki Cathedral (yellow). The university departments and facilities are scattered in an arc behind the square, but this is the symbolic heart of the city. 3. Accra, Ghana Although the University of Ghana has its main campus at Legon, 12km north of the city centre, it also has a smaller campus in the city centre (red), near to several government ministries (blue), the African Development Bank, the National Theatre and the International Conference Centre (yellow). 4. Birmingham, England You don\u0026rsquo;t need to be built as part of the original city centre development to be an anchor tenant. We return to Birmingham, but this time to a different station - Curzon Street. Birmingham City University (BCU) is investing heavily in Birmingham\u0026rsquo;s Eastside (red), near the proposed site of the High Speed 2 railway terminal (blue). BCU is anticipating the future, and actively shaping it - in this case by helping establish a college for rail engineering. There are thousands more examples throughout the world, including universities who are anchor institutions in smaller towns and cities. Some have been deliberately placed by city planners hundreds of years ago next to government buildings. Others are pre-empting new hearts of cities. Some have a central presence that links to external sites (we can also see this with university satellite campuses in London, for example). Whether the buildings themselves are new or old, the planning is long term. My initial impression is that \u0026lsquo;micro-location\u0026rsquo; counts. That is, it may not always be enough to be within a particular city. Sometimes it matters exactly where you are - if you are across the road from parliament, you are likely to be consulted ahead of institutions further out. And if you take the initiative and build in an area of potential strategic importance, and invest heavily, and have room for expansion, business and industry will co-locate with you.\n","date":"22 April 2016","permalink":"/posts/anchor-tenants/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"When the Grand Central shopping centre in Birmingham opened alongside a redeveloped New Street Station in September 2015, a fair amount of the fanfare was directed towards John Lewis, the \u0026lsquo;anchor tenant\u0026rsquo; in the development.","title":"Anchor tenants"},{"content":" September 2019 update: The Office for Students has introduced an experimental but more sophisticated successor to POLAR called TUNDRA. Wonkhe have published a helpful summary with some of the limitations and context. The links below may no longer work following the closure of HEFCE, but POLAR can be found on the same page as TUNDRA.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been working with some of the Higher Education Funding Council for England\u0026rsquo;s (HEFCE) datasets on young people\u0026rsquo;s participation in higher education, and was thinking how useful and interesting this information would be on a global scale. There are two key maps. The first is Participation of Local Areas (POLAR); see an example for Brighton, UK, above. The POLAR classification looks at how likely young people are to participate in higher education across the UK and shows how this varies by area. Areas in red are those that have the lowest participation rates while areas in dark blue are those that have the highest participation rates. Yellow is in the middle. The second is more nuanced and perhaps more useful. It shows gaps in participation - the proportion of young people participating in higher education compared to that expected given GCSE-level attainment and ethnic profile. In the example above, also for Brighton, in those areas shaded red young participation is much lower than expected. In those areas shaded blue, participation is much higher than expected. In those areas shaded white, young participation rates are as expected. Whilst higher education participation data is probably available at country or broader sub-country level for most countries, the real value is in the hyper-local detail - in this case at the level of electoral wards, of which there are 7,669 in England alone. The potential insights are obvious from the discrepancies in colour between neighbouring wards. I\u0026rsquo;d be fascinated to see other countries divided into 7,500 sections and each section scored for higher education participation - would countries with similar inequality levels or income levels look similar? How do urban and rural areas compare across countries? How about those areas in close proximity to a cluster of universities or a major transport network? Or those close to a border of a wealthier neighbour?

I have a couple of thoughts on their potential:\nCan smart cities be to cities what smartphones are to \u0026lsquo;dumb\u0026rsquo; phones? A button (non-smart) phone today seems closed and antiquated compared to the limitless panoply of apps and the functionality of touchscreen phones. Or will the \u0026lsquo;wide experiential gulf\u0026rsquo; between the top-end smartphones and generic low-end smartphone handsets be replicated in tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s smart cities? I suspect there will be wide variations in effective implementation, and I suspect the impact will be far less dramatic and sudden than the shift from \u0026lsquo;dumb\u0026rsquo; to smart phones. Cities have been developing for thousands of years and smart infrastructure needs to be embedded and layered upon existing foundations. But a transformative, positive wave of impact is possible. Can this wave of possible impact enable some cities to \u0026rsquo;leapfrog\u0026rsquo; their development? Comparing cities again to phones, think of a country with limited phone networks skipping the installation of telegraph poles and landlines and instead building a fast mobile network. Kenya, for example, has excellent mobile phone reception in remote areas but limited landlines. So could a smart city allow urban areas with poor healthcare, high crime, limited access to, for example, banks and bus routes, and areas of general deprivation to leapfrog some of the traditional, slower means of development? Unfortunately, smart cities are no shortcut, and mobile phones are an unusually effective leapfrogger. Instead, you usually need to have gone \u0026lsquo;medium tech\u0026rsquo; before you can go \u0026lsquo;high tech\u0026rsquo;. So what is needed? Cities will need to be both adaptable and smart. Underpinning both is social capital. The World Economic Forum has developed a four part taxonomy of city competitiveness, with ‘soft connectivity’, a city’s social capital, a critical factor. Education is the ‘ultimate soft connectivity’, and cities can specialise in knowledge intensive niches by capitalising on education. Education and soft connectivity make investments in hard infrastructure and new technology more productive. Cities are constantly in states of flow, and can easily be locked into patterns of behaviour that over time can have serious consequences. A city with a highly skilled workforce, with access to continuous education and training opportunities, is also a highly adaptive one. An adaptive city is a resilient city. Work by Nesta has shown that 87 percent of highly creative workers are at low or no risk of automation compared with 40 percent of jobs in the UK as a whole. You can complete an online survey to determine whether your job is at risk of being taken by a robot. Whilst automation is likely to solve many more problems than it creates, a successful city in future years will adapt to these changes, attracting creative industries and highly skilled jobs. The objectives of ‘smart’ and ‘adaptable’ cities are mutually reinforcing, with a smart city a more responsive one, and an adaptable city more likely to benefit from the insights delivered through data and technology. Universities play an important role in developing and testing new technologies, curating and understanding data (and the infrastructure behind it), and conceptualising and operationalising the ‘Internet of Things’ – a network of physical objects that collect and exchange information. City leaders and universities will need to work together to harness the benefits of smart cities. The UK Future Cities Catapult is a good example of this, bringing together businesses, universities and city leaders to turn ideas into prototypes, including developing sensor networks and unlocking urban data. There is particular focus on smart cities in emerging economies. The Catapult has just signed an MOU with the China Center for Urban Development, building on smart city collaboration two years ago between Bristol and Guangzhou, and last year between Manchester and Wuhan. And in 2015 India set a target of 100 smart cities, focussing on satellite towns of larger cities and modernising existing mid-sized cities. It will be interesting to see whether any \u0026rsquo;leapfrogging\u0026rsquo; takes place within these cities, and how inclusive the benefits are.\nThere are many definitions of smart cities, but I like the European Commission one: \u0026lsquo;a place where the traditional networks and services are made more efficient with the use of digital and telecommunication technologies, for the benefit of its inhabitants and businesses\u0026rsquo;. ↩ ","date":"1 April 2016","permalink":"/posts/how-universities-can-help-smart-cities-become-transformative-and-why-leapfrogging-is-difficult/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"We are some way from realising the transformative effects of smart cities,1 and further still from these effects benefiting the poorest in society.","title":"How universities can help 'smart cities' become transformative (and why leapfrogging is difficult)"},{"content":"New research published today from the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics:\nWe compiled new data based on UNESCO’s World Higher Education Database detailing the location of 15,000 universities in 1,500 sub-national regions across 78 countries over the period 1950 to 2010.

I was at an event recently when a director of a very large education company compared universities today to the music industry in 2002: unwilling to embrace innovation, with the education equivalent of a Napster - perhaps online learning - waiting around the corner to smash the sector to pieces. The analogy of university campuses as CDs and MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) as MP3s is a nice marketing trick for management consultancies, but it dangerously underplays the important role of universities in their locality (more on that here). Most recently such predictions (often found in the comments sections of online newspaper articles) have been in response to the rise of higher-level apprenticeships and government targets of creating 3 million apprenticeships by 2020. A common narrative is that \u0026rsquo;traditional\u0026rsquo; degrees don\u0026rsquo;t provide workplace skills, going to university is a waste of time, and there are too many graduates. The evidence disagrees. Such comments aren\u0026rsquo;t new. Back in 1997 Peter Drucker, the famous business and management author, predicted that\nThirty years from now the big university campuses will be relics. Universities won’t survive. It’s as large a change as when we first got the printed book.\nAdmittedly we won\u0026rsquo;t know whether he\u0026rsquo;s right until 2027. However, I\u0026rsquo;m quietly confident we\u0026rsquo;ll see big university campuses for centuries to come. Some may close and others will expand. But \u0026lsquo;going to university\u0026rsquo; - physically going to a set of buildings and a space with an identity and lots of other students and teachers from many different places and with different perspectives and ideas - is a huge draw for students.1 But the main reason I think he\u0026rsquo;s wrong is the role of universities in their cities and regions, and the importance of knowledge institutions in knowledge economies. Universities are brokers and coordinators and ideas machines and leaders at a time when decision making is becoming more local, and powers and decisions are being devolved to towns and cities and regions. We can also look at what\u0026rsquo;s happening in the most populated countries in the world. If universities are dying, surely the most vibrant and ambitious nations would be investing their resources elsewhere? Just last week it was reported that China is opening a new university every week. India\u0026rsquo;s February 2016 budget proposes a scheme to create 20 world-class universities.

Europe\u0026rsquo;s best engineers, who had cut through the Alps, said it could not be done\u0026hellip;. But the Chinese built it. Perhaps only they could have done. The line into the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, was opened in 2006 by the then Chinese President Hu Jintao. Now passenger and goods trains arrive from as far away as Shanghai and Beijing, four times a day, every day. They bring with them many things, such as consumer goods from across China, computers, colour televisions and mobile phones. They bring tourists who support the local economy, they bring modernity to an ancient and impoverished land\u0026hellip; But they have also brought several million Han Chinese settlers.\nI draw from this a maxim: where you encourage migration, you direct political and economic energy. What could this mean for higher education in China?\nThe C9 League, regarded as the most prestigious Chinese universities, are largely based on the east coast (see image at top). With the continued \u0026lsquo;rebalancing\u0026rsquo; away from the coastal cities to the inland provinces, we will see investment in inland universities, both to attract the best students and provide training and education to suit local needs, and increase local research capacity. Focus will continue on improving Chinese universities in general. We know that China leads the world in the rate of expansion of investment in higher education and innovation. In 2012, China’s total expenditure on research and development exceeded one trillion RMB - that’s almost $0.5bn per day! 1 10% of this is directed to the C9 League. Until recently, the government encouraged the brightest Chinese students to study abroad. As Chinese universities improve in quality, expect a corresponding increase in the number of the brightest Chinese students studying in China (bearing in mind that the 18- to 22-year-old population will decline by 2025).2 This pivot is symptomatic of China\u0026rsquo;s increasing confidence in the quality of its research and teaching, and a more general economic focus on innovative, knowledge-driven industries. In line with this, China will continue to increase the numbers of scholarships and fellowships to students from other countries, following in the footsteps of the extensive scholarship programmes offered by Western countries (for example, the UK has seen year-on-year growth in its Chevening and Commonwealth scholarship programmes, despite widespread government cuts). Scholarships are often regarded primarily as weapons of \u0026lsquo;soft power\u0026rsquo;, and it certainly helps when an international alumnus becomes president. However, scholarships also encourage the finest minds to develop their ideas in your country, they increase multiculturalism, they lead to academic collaboration, and they are a pretty sound domestic economic investment, given most of the money is spent in the region of the university. The same Nesta publication reports that in 1998, 830,000 students graduated with a higher education qualification in China. By 2012, graduate numbers hit 6.2 million, and by 2020, they are predicted to reach 10.5 million. This would account for almost a third of the world’s total, and more than the USA and EU combined. Although there are questions over the quality of education, there are longstanding efforts to improve the standard of research and socioeconomic impact of Chinese universities (such as Project 211, focused on a subset of universities). ↩ Interestingly, China will need to sell this shift above all to parents. Traditionally parents save for their children\u0026rsquo;s education from a young age; education is sold directly to parents rather than through any state financing or loans as seen in many other countries. ↩ ","date":"29 February 2016","permalink":"/posts/the-future-of-chinese-higher-education-what-we-can-learn-from-geopolitics/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m currently reading two excellent books that cover, in part, the future of China.","title":"The future of Chinese higher education: what we can learn from geopolitics"},{"content":"Bruce Katz, centennial scholar at the Brookings Institution and former Professor in Social Policy at LSE, recently wrote a blog arguing that “In 2016, Nations May Govern But Cities Rule”. He says:\nthe locus of problem-solving is devolving downward. Cities have become the engines of national economies and the vanguard of economic and social innovation. In 2016, devolution will accelerate, and the solutions to our toughest problems will increasingly come from local leaders, acting in close concert with institutional investors, global corporations, and higher levels of government.\nHis outline of new instruments, intermediaries, and institutions for problem solving is well worth a read. He makes the point that informal devolution is outpacing formal devolution, calling for ‘rapid, locally-tailored solutions that take a holistic approach to problem-solving – approaches that deploy the expertise, capacity, and resources of the public, private, and civic sectors in collaboration’. I make a similar point in an essay published by the Government Office for Science that looks at the role of universities in future cities. Cities will tackle some problems traditionally shouldered by states. Many of these problems are interdisciplinary, and universities are ideally positioned to help provide an interdisciplinary response. One point Katz doesn’t mention is that, although cities will indeed increasingly rule, connections with other cities becomes increasingly important. A ‘system of cities’ takes into account the different specialities of cities, the different challenges and opportunities and local knowledge and physical assets, and how cities can complement each other. The problems of the future will increasingly be tackled by cities themselves, supported by universities and a wider system of cities.\nRead the Government Office for Science essay on the future of universities and cities here, and my post on systems of cities on the Government Office for Science blog here.\n","date":"6 January 2016","permalink":"/posts/nations-cities-and-universities/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"Bruce Katz, centennial scholar at the Brookings Institution and former Professor in Social Policy at LSE, recently wrote a blog arguing that “In 2016, Nations May Govern But Cities Rule”.","title":"Nations, cities and universities"},{"content":" Available here (external link).

Secondly, DFID is funding a multi-country research programme called Research on Improving Systems of Education (RISE) studying education systems in developing countries (website, press release). This work is focussed on children in school rather than higher education, noting the success over the past 15 years in getting more children into school but the need for more evidence on the interactions within education systems for policies to be successful. However, better primary education systems can only be a good thing for a long term, highly skilled workforce, with more children able to later attend secondary education, and attend university, and excel at both.

I was fortunate to present at the first event at Columbia University, New York, in 2013. My research examined the great insights that organisations such as the UN have gained by adapting Big Data techniques for international development, and looked at whether civil society could similarly harness this technology. My premise for doing so was part of a lofty ideal - to ‘decentralise’ development, to move the centres of development power away from multinational bodies and towards smaller players. You can read the conference paper here (PDF file, pp. 26-35), including case studies of corruption, cocaine and malaria. Big Data presents exciting opportunities for understanding and tackling development issues. Agencies such as UN Global Pulse are pushing this work forward, opening offices in Jakarta and Kampala. Small organisations and civil society will increasingly work with Big Data as the hurdles to harnessing meaningful insights decrease. Large organisations such as Amazon.com have long used Big Data as a foundation for understanding customers. But there is a key role for universities too, and not just through using Big Data to improve teaching and learning. As Simon McGrath notes, higher education has a role in engaging with some of the recent ‘big development ideas’, from the call for a ‘data revolution’, through enthusiasm for ‘evidence-based policymaking’, to the rise of the ‘what works’ agenda. Big Data isn’t a panacea for solving all development challenges. Universities can help frame Big Data within the wider context of development processes, they can rigorously scrutinise methods and policy conclusions, and can use Big Data to complement the wider research agenda. At the same time, universities often work both locally and internationally, and can draw on the benefits Big Data is delivering to both small organisations and multinational agencies.\n","date":"3 July 2015","permalink":"/posts/universities-and-big-data/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"It’s great to see the International Conference On Sustainable Development is returning for the third year running this September.","title":"Universities and Big Data"},{"content":"At the core of increasing collaboration between universities and businesses is getting people from each to talk to one another. I’ve written elsewhere about the benefits of collaboration. When universities work with businesses, economic growth happens. Broken down further, when universities work with businesses, businesses can access new technology and knowledge and apply this to their work, become more innovative, and improve the skills of their staff. Universities can improve the employability of their students, and test new research in a ‘real world’ setting. When the two work together, new jobs are created, productivity increases and everybody benefits. At least, that is how the theory goes. How does this work in practice? Strip collaboration to the core and you’re left with the need for people from universities to speak to businesses, and vice versa. Here are two ways to encourage this - one nudging businesses towards universities, and one students towards small employers:\nInnovation vouchers provide funding for businesses to access external expertise. They reduce the risks that businesses (especially small ones) face, and can attract larger investments and build partnerships. Appropriately tailored and effectively marketed, these relatively small investments benefit universities and businesses, and long term can boost growth and employment. You can read more on how vouchers work and their benefits from the OECD and Universities UK. Careers services can promote the benefits of working for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), and encourage students to take up a placement, internship or job at an SME. Students may have misconceptions about small businesses - that they aren’t as innovative as multinationals, for example - that can be dispelled by a few well-chosen case studies. The CBI recently published an excellent guide to university-business collaboration with a practical focus. Although this, and the above links, are UK- or European-focused, they are equally applicable (with tailoring to local context) to low-income countries. This is a particularly exciting area and a source of long term economic growth and innovation.\n","date":"2 May 2015","permalink":"/posts/two-ways-to-push-university-business-collaboration/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"At the core of increasing collaboration between universities and businesses is getting people from each to talk to one another.","title":"Two ways to push university-business collaboration"},{"content":"Last week the Overseas Development Institute published an excellent report, Working for economic transformation, on generating better jobs in low income countries. The report notes that countries need to make decisions in education policy to match labour market demand:\nPromoting higher-level technical or university education, more expensive per student, can help facilitate the leap to more productive sectors. But this can come at the cost of reduced funding for junior levels of education, which might allow for a wider boost to low-productivity employment. It can also help to exacerbate inequalities in education, with tertiary places more often taken up by those from wealthier backgrounds. Increasing investment in lower levels of education tends to have a greater effect on improving attainment outcomes among the poorest. At the same time, expanding educational enrolment and attainment may reduce available funding necessary for higher-quality education, such as for school facilities, teacher training and wages. (p.28)\nIn other words, there is a budgetary choice to be made between strengthening schools (junior levels of education) or universities (higher levels of education), and there are clear opportunity costs for each. In policy terms, however, education should be seen as a continuum from school to college to university, and higher education has a role to play in strengthening the stages that come before it. This role needs to be explored and expanded and encapsulated in government policy: universities can train the teachers and advise on curriculum design to strengthen junior education. Their links with businesses can ensure future skills needs are being met throughout the system. At the same time, universities can work with businesses, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to support their growth and in turn their demand for highly skilled graduates. Facilitating internships and placements for students in industry further strengthens these links, and provides a technical and enterprise focus to degrees. As the report concludes:\nSetting employment at the centre of development agendas requires a whole range of policies, plus coordination among these policies and of the dynamics between different sectors of the economy. Education policies need to be matched with the requirements of growing industries with productive employment potential. (p.39)\nThe continuum between junior and higher levels of education becomes particularly important when we consider development policy. One consequence of the Millennium Development Goals focus on achieving universal primary education is the pipeline of students who could potentially go on to study at university as the MDGs draw to a close this year. Treating each stage in isolation risks missing the opportunity to greatly increase the amount of highly skilled jobs created worldwide in the years ahead.\n","date":"1 April 2015","permalink":"/posts/working-for-economic-transformation/","section":"Blog posts","summary":"Last week the Overseas Development Institute published an excellent report, Working for economic transformation, on generating better jobs in low income countries.","title":"Working for economic transformation"},{"content":" Available here (external link).

This study challenges this reputation and argues that, whilst such a method (as with any other) can be abused, it has particular promise as a tool to be used for monitoring and explorative research, especially by smaller development organisations. Drawing on recent advances in adapting commercial ‘Big Data’ techniques for use in international development, this study uses an example data set of global news reports to measure the level of discussion about corruption using a Text Mining methodology. The methodology outlined holds particular promise for tracking the dissemination of ideas and concepts, although it is heavily dependent on contextual interpretation and the quality of the data set used.\n","date":"1 June 2013","permalink":"/publications/data-mining-for-development/","section":"Research and policy publications","summary":"MSc thesis which looks at how small civil society organisations can adapt big data for international development applications.","title":"Replicating Data Mining Techniques for Development: A Case Study of Corruption"},{"content":" Available here (external link, PDF).
