### Forget science fiction. We need to think differently about smart cities.

From 2018–2019 I led an eight country research project looking at how universities can shape ‘smart cities’, funded by the British Council. The final report, [_Smart places – how universities are shaping a new wave of smart cities_]({{< ref "publications/smart-places" >}}), was launched in Berlin at the Going Global 2019 conference.

A [summary article]({{< ref "publications/new-wave-of-smart-cities" >}}) in _The Conversation_ has been read over 34,000 times. The research has been featured in the media from _The i newspaper_ and _Fast Company_ magazine to _City Metric_ and _Yahoo News_, and I was [interviewed]({{< ref "publications/cna-radio-interview" >}}) about the findings on Singapore radio.

I’ve also written extensively about smart cities on this site – see below – including reflections on how some of my thinking has evolved since the report.
