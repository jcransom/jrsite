{{< lead >}} Research that changes the conversation. Reports that tell a story. {{< /lead >}}

Over the past few years I have completed work for the British Council, the Royal Society, the British Academy, Imperial College London, Greater Manchester Universities, KPMG, GuildHE, Rwanda Action, the University of Hamburg, Universities UK, the Government Office for Science, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (now Research England) and British Council International Education Services.

I’m also Head of Research at the National Centre for Entrepreneurship in Education (NCEE), and an Associate at Yorkshire Universities. I am a PhD candidate at UCL Institute of Education, looking at the roles of universities in cities in Africa.

In 2018-19 I led an [eight country research project]({{< ref "smart-cities" >}}) for the British Council on 'smart cities' which attracted national and international press coverage.

In the past I’ve worked for Universities UK, UNESCO Vietnam, and the Association of Commonwealth Universities. I have also been a Research Affiliate at the University of Rwanda, an Associate at Work and Learning Opportunities (a Sussex-based social enterprise), and an Advisory Associate at the Class of 2020, a Dutch NGO focused on urban campuses. I have also been a reading committee member for the UK Government's Chevening scholarship programme.
