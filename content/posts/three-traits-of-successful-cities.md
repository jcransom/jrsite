A few weeks ago I was honoured to chair a panel session in Lisbon on city strategies for talent attraction, bringing together speakers from Portugal, Italy and Germany. In my opening remarks I picked three traits of cities that successfully attract talent. Because all three rely on cooperation with universities, these are also the traits of the successful universities of the future:

1.  **Universities jointly collaborate with the city.** Of course, this only applies where there are multiple universities. But where this is the case, institutions work together, speaking to the city with one voice, pooling resources and avoiding multiple bilateral conversations. For some great examples of this, see my [recent report](https://jcransom.com/2017/11/18/university-superpowers/) looking at how the universities in Toronto have produced joint research projects to benefit the city, have come together to bid for UNESCO City of Culture status, and much more.
2.  **They reach marginalised communities.** Universities and cities work together to spread the benefits of internationalisation to communities that are geographically more distant or otherwise may feel ‘left behind’. My [report for the British Council](https://jcransom.com/2017/07/02/the-future-of-european-internationalisation/) shows how Dublin, Glasgow, Hannover and Amsterdam are working to involve marginalised communities in internationalisation activities.
3.  **An entrepreneurial use of space.** Successful urban universities, when forced (often through limited space) to think creatively when developing new buildings and inner-city spaces, blur the edges between the city and the university. By mixing the two and reimagining public spaces, planners can bring different groups of people together and allow new ideas to spread. Ryerson University, featured in the [Toronto report](https://jcransom.com/2017/11/18/university-superpowers/), is a great example ([more here](https://torontolife.com/city/the-ryerson-revolution-how-the-once-dumpy-polytechnic-is-redrawing-downtown/)). Birmingham City University’s [expansion](https://jcransom.com/2016/04/22/anchor-tenants/) near Curzon Street station is another ([more here](http://www.bcu.ac.uk/news-events/news/curzon-building-opens-to-students)).
    

The conference was organised by _[The Class of 2020](https://theclassof2020.org/)_, a Dutch think tank looking at student living. At the conference they launched their 2018 _[Annual Trends Report](https://issuu.com/theclassof2020/docs/the_class_of_2020_trend_report_2018/8)_ including an article by myself on what we can learn from computer games about university-city collaboration.
