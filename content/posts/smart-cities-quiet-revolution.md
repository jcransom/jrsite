A final quick post on my recent British Council research before we resume our usual programming: todayâ€™s i newspaper (23 July 2019) has a short piece from myself covering universities and smart cities in Nottingham, on page 18. ![](https://ransomjc.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/i-news-23072019-small.jpg) You can read the full report [here](http://bit.ly/smartplacesreport), a summary on The Conversation [here](https://theconversation.com/new-wave-of-smart-cities-has-arrived-and-theyre-nothing-like-science-fiction-119855), and a podcast of the smart cities session at Going Global 2019 in Berlin [here](https://jcransom.com/2019/06/04/session-at-going-global-2019/).
