Today a report I wrote for Yorkshire Universities was published, looking at [how universities can help attract inward investment and boost trade](https://yorkshireuniversities.ac.uk/2021/10/14/new-yu-report-universities-and-place-promotion-in-west-yorkshire/). You probably won’t be surprised to hear it approaches these topics through a regional lens.
