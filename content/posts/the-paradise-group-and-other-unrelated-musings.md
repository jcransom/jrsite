![Welcome to Paradise City](https://ransomjc.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/welcome-to-paradise-city.jpg) A new [“Russell Group type” alliance of the top universities in Africa](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/africa-university-alliance-will-boost-higher-education) will bring together 15 universities from 8 countries. Notwithstanding the difficulties of coordinating activity from Lagos to Pretoria and from Dakar to Kampala - and research collaboration is one of the [main aims](http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20150310185922166) - such a group is overdue. One of the strengths of the UK system is the diversity of institutions. It would be good to also see a [University Alliance](http://www.unialliance.ac.uk/) for Africa, although a regional network may be more effective - for example a West or East African grouping. Of course, such groups need a good name. The Russell Group is named after the hotel in Bloomsbury where the group was formed. I remember staying at Paradise City Hotel in Nigeria - the Paradise Group does have a good ring to it...

City leadership 'missing a trick'
---------------------------------

The Government Office for Science recently published a report on ['the future of city leadership in the United Kingdom'](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/future-of-cities-city-leadership-in-the-uk). It's good to see a recommendation to integrate local universities into city leadership, and to use universities as part of a wide knowledge base for informing leadership (page 37):

> City networks can enhance learning as cities work together, as can partnerships with universities and think tanks. Some workshop participants citied a growing involvement and contribution from universities in their work, while others felt that cities were often “missing a trick” where universities were concerned. This “trick” might be a critical way for city leaders to leverage local resources to increase their knowledge and hence their capacity. Universities can serve as independent and neutral partners, providing academic rigour to the evidence used to inform policy and programme development. Long-term collaborations (as opposed to individual projects) that involve joint working and co-production of knowledge in particular can bring substantial benefits to cities.

We're doing work on this at Universities UK in light of devolution, and feeding into House of Commons inquires such as [this one](http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/business-innovation-and-skills/news-parliament-2015/powerhouses-and-engines-launch-15-16/) looking at the Northern Powerhouse and Midlands Engine. Leadership is important both within and across cities, especially in new geographies that aim to create ['systems of cities'](https://futureofcities.blog.gov.uk/2015/12/18/role-of-universities/).

Learning Circle: peer-to-peer education
---------------------------------------

![GNU_Emacs_ELIZA_example](https://ransomjc.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gnu_emacs_eliza_example.png) _Image: A bad example of Eliza the chatbot_ A Pearson/UCL Institute of Education paper [makes the case](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/news-events/news-pub/april-2016/New-paper-published-by-pearson-makes-the-case-for-why-we-must-take-artificial-intelligence-in-education-more-seriously) for taking artificial intelligence in education more seriously. We've had [realistic psychotherapists](https://www.edge.org/conversation/eliza-39s-world) since the 1960s, today [chatbots are about to take off](http://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21696477-market-apps-maturing-now-one-text-based-services-or-chatbots-looks-poised), and in the near future automation and machine learning offer [huge potential rewards](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n05/john-lanchester/the-robots-are-coming) to those who can capitalise on them. Chatbots in education are highly unlikely to replace lecturers any time soon. But a bot you could add on WhatsApp that you can ask to reserve a book in the library, or book a room for group study, or advise on research resources, or provide basic pastoral support, or request transcripts is certainly possible today. I also wonder what the education equivalent of a [Funding Circle](https://www.fundingcircle.com/) or a [Ratesetter](https://www.ratesetter.com/) might look like. These [FinTech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology) services bypass banks and allow individuals to lend money at a higher interest rate and others to borrow money at a lower rate than at banks, by mediating between the two and taking a small cut in the middle. A higher education equivalent would bypass the institution and allow lecturers to teach small groups directly - the opposite end of the scale to [MOOCs](http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/highereducation/Pages/MOOCsHigherEducationDigitalMoment.aspx). Ultimately, however, you'd still face the same issues as MOOCs in terms of accreditation, and lose the many benefits of [studying at university](https://jcransom.com/2016/03/21/the-myth-of-the-dying-university/). _Images: Paradise City Hotel, Calabar, Nigeria / Example of ELIZA in Emacs by Ysangkok at English Wikipedia (https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2236326)_
