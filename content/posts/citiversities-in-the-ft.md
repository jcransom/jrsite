It’s always interesting to read about the role of universities in cities, especially when the university in question is the one where you are studying for a PhD on universities and cities. This time, it is [the FT looking at UCL’s rapid expansion](https://www.ft.com/content/b27f84f8-1006-11e8-940e-08320fc2a277) into east London following reports of academic unease over the institution’s plans. There’s a quite a bit to unpack in the article, from universities as city brands (a big part of [this work](https://jcransom.com/2017/07/02/the-future-of-european-internationalisation/) for the British Council), to the globalisation of higher education and the forces compelling relentless campus expansion within urban areas. But the crux of the article is this:

> UCL is not alone in seeking to expand to secure its place in the world’s premier league of universities. New York University, founded at about the same time, has opened a technology hub in Brooklyn, and Columbia is thrusting into West Harlem as part of a $6bn growth plan. It is hard to walk through cities without coming across construction sites for new college campuses.

With the conclusion that:

> Perhaps a better way to regard urban institutions such as UCL is not as multiversities but “citiversities” — the core industry of city states in a globalised world. Attending them, for better and worse, is quite different from going to a little liberal arts college such as Oberlin in Ohio.

The notion of a ‘citiversity’ is a nice inversion of the ‘univercity’ [popularised by the RSA](https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-articles/reports/univercities-the-knowledge-to-power-uk-metros). Have we been looking at the relationship the wrong way around - do universities help build cities, or do cities cultivate their universities? The answer is probably the slightly boring one - a bit of both (a case study in point [here](https://jcransom.com/2017/11/18/university-superpowers/)).
