Three loosely-related reflections on new things:

### When anchors move

The [More Means Better](https://moremeansbetter.wordpress.com/) blog has an interesting [new post](https://moremeansbetter.wordpress.com/2019/09/24/migrating-institutions/) on universities that have moved home, in some cases to entirely different parts of the country. Some I knew about, others were new. It’s a helpful reminder that even universities, seen as one of the most dependable ‘[anchor institutions](https://jcransom.com/2017/10/13/when-anchors-call-the-shots/)’, can up and leave when they deem it necessary (although it is pretty rare).

### The college of the future

One institution embedded in more communities and neighbourhoods than universities is the further education college - often overlooked in conversations about anchors. I joined a seminar last week by the [Independent Commission on the College of the Future](https://www.collegecommission.co.uk/) asking what we want and need from our colleges from 2030 onwards. Most discussions returned to the essential local role of colleges (and a lack of public appreciation for the wide-ranging responsibilities they take on), their ability to act as community and business hubs (especially for the long tail of less-productive small businesses), and as a conduit to higher education, careers and apprenticeships. This commission seems to have the ear of government, is chaired by the highly regarded Sir Ian Diamond (who has an extensive background in higher education, and will soon be the UK’s National Statistician), and is well-timed given the widely acknowledged need for support for the further education sector. The final report will be published in Spring 2020 and I expect it to be influential.

### Better local data

I first [wrote about](https://jcransom.com/2016/04/10/polar-for-the-world/) the POLAR dataset back in 2016. It is helpful to measure the extent to which young people participate in higher education at a local level because where you are from is closely linked to your future education prospects, your health and your economic prosperity. The Office for Students has introduced an experimental but more sophisticated successor to POLAR called [TUNDRA](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/data-and-analysis/young-participation-by-area/). Wonkhe have published a [helpful summary](https://wonkhe.com/blogs/a-cold-spot-on-the-tundra/) with some of the limitations and context. More detailed data at a more local level is definitely a good thing - as with previous work by HEFCE on ‘cold spot’ areas that are missing a university. However, as data becomes more complex it often needs heavy caveating, as we have seen with the [LEO data](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/data-and-analysis/graduate-earnings-data-on-unistats/) on graduate earnings - which is beginning to [include a place dimension](https://wonkhe.com/blogs/regional-leo-at-last-well-not-quite/).
