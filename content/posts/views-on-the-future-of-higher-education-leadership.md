The [2019 NCEE leadership survey report](http://bit.ly/2pzVvTf) was launched last night in London, capturing the views of over 50 senior higher education leaders.

The report sits alongside, but has a different focus to, other snapshot surveys of UK higher education: [PA’s](https://www.paconsulting.com/insights/2019/our-tenth-university-vice-chancellor-survey/) annual look at the views of vice chancellors on funding and policy, and [Wonkhe’s](https://wonkhe.com/wonkhe-360-front-line-perspectives-on-he-policy/) survey of university staff working in policy.

I provided the analysis and wrote the report. Read my blog on 10 key findings [here](https://ncee.org.uk/2019/10/21/our-top-10-what-we-learned-about-leadership/), coverage in _Times Higher Education_ [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/hub/p/change-management-and-entrepreneurial-leadership), and the full report (PDF) [here](http://bit.ly/2pzVvTf).
