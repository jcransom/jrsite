summary: Insights from polling of over 1,000 local residents in Greater Manchester.

Five universities in Greater Manchester and the Combined Authority recently undertook polling of over 1,000 local residents. The [overall summary](https://civicuniversitynetwork.co.uk/greater-manchester/) is interesting – for example that over half of residents have never visited a local university – but there are some gems hidden in the [230 pages of polling data](https://civicuniversitynetwork.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GM-Universities-Full-tables.pdf).

Take this, for example, from page 186:
 
> Now imagine that you had to choose between the universities staying as they are, and the universities leaving the city region and you receiving £5 a year in compensation. Would you be happy for the local universities to leave the city region?
 
**Six percent** of those who earn £15,000 to £19,999 said they would prefer to receive £5 a year in compensation, and allow the local universities to leave the city region. **24 percent** of those who earn £40,000 to £44,999 said the same.

If the offer changes to £100, and we consider level of education (page 193), **12 percent** of those educated to GCSE level said they would prefer to receive £100 a year in compensation, and allow the local universities to leave the city region. **22 percent** of doctorates said the same.
 
To be fair the proportions also rose for those who wanted the universities to stay; there are fewer people uncertain at greater levels of education. And the sample sizes involved are not large.
