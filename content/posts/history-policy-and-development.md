Having studied both history and international development, I'm always interested in work that bridges the two. ['History, Historians and Development Policy'](https://www.amazon.co.uk/History-Historians-Development-Policy-Necessary/dp/0719085772) fits the bill perfectly. One of the many valuable lessons to draw from such work is the importance of taking a long term view:

> ...history brings a particular kind of perspective to development problems - it is a vantage point for framing and viewing the nature of development which is relatively long term and comparative, while also paying full attention to, and not shying away from, critical issues of power, contestation and conflict. (p.16)

In policy both the medium and long term views are often sacrificed in favour of the short term, for example the apparent willingness to erase the [institutional memory on higher education](http://www.hepi.ac.uk/2016/01/30/bis-to-erase-its-institutional-memory-on-higher-education/) within government. Although this rarely results in [colossal blunders](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Blunders-Our-Governments-Anthony-King/dp/1780742665), it clearly hinders effective learning and can engender cynicism in those on the receiving end. At the other end of the spectrum, it is an interesting exercise to free ourselves from the short and medium term and think ultra long term. For example, [this piece](http://qz.com/666153/megacities-not-nations-are-the-worlds-most-dominant-enduring-social-structures-adapted-from-connectography/) argues that ‘megacities, not nations, are the world’s dominant, enduring social structures', and that cities have outlasted all ‘empires and nations over which they have presided'. If we were to frame development in terms of cities (and the towns in their orbit and the spaces that separate them) rather than nations, how would this affect policy? And would, for example, universities in those cities change their strategies? (I'll look at this [next week](http://jcransom.com/2016/05/20/interregional-relations/)). We should welcome historians into policymaking. The excellent [History & Policy](http://www.historyandpolicy.org/) site attempts to do just that. An essay from 2010 on ['The ‘Idea of a University’ today'](http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/the-idea-of-a-university-today) concludes:

> If we seek guidance from the past, it is better to see the 'idea of the university' not as a fixed set of characteristics, but as a set of tensions, permanently present, but resolved differently according to time and place. Tensions between teaching and research, and between autonomy and accountability, most obviously. But also between universities' membership of an international scholarly community, and their role in shaping national cultures and forming national identity; between the transmission of established knowledge, and the search for original truth; between the inevitable connection of universities with the state and the centres of economic and social power, and the need to maintain critical distance; between reproducing the existing occupational structure, and renewing it from below by promoting social mobility; between serving the economy, and providing a space free from immediate utilitarian pressures; between teaching as the encouragement of open and critical attitudes, and society's expectation that universities will impart qualifications and skills. To come down too heavily on one side of these balances will usually mean that the aims of the university are being simplified and distorted.
