There’s [plenty](https://wfhmanual.com/#tips) being [written](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/workplace-email-policy) at the [moment](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51868894) about staying sane whilst working from home, adapting to the change of lifestyle, and maintaining effective communication with distant colleagues. But here are four tools that have helped me to actually _get good work done_ whilst I work from home (which I did two or three days per week until October 2018, and have done full-time since). Most of these are equally applicable in an office, but can seriously improve your output at home.

### 1\. The right music

Carefully chosen music can encourage deep focus and boost productivity. The best tool I’ve found for this is [Brain.fm](https://www.brain.fm/). The service boasts of ‘Functional Music to Improve Focus in 15 Minutes’. Regardless of whether the science behind the music stacks up, I find it invaluable for tasks requiring concentration (most of my PhD so far has been written to the ‘Cinematic Music Focus’ station). [This link provides a free trial](http://brain.fm/invite/2mpAlZV9rR).

A free alternative (but be wary of adverts interrupting your flow) is computer game soundtracks on YouTube – or playlists of such music on Spotify or other music services. These are designed to engage you in the task at hand and for background distractions to fade away. [This YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRQo9K9EMR1etIaZZ9_iPvA) is a good place to start.

### 2\. Laptop stand

A very basic recommendation, but an essential one. I use an AmazonBasics laptop stand that cost a little over £10. It will save your back and neck. Requires separate keyboard and mouse, which are also worthwhile investments.

### 3\. Distraction blocker

Stop yourself from mindlessly browsing the news or social media with a distraction blocker. I use [Freedom](https://freedom.to/?rfsn=3877129.25dbd9) which can block websites and applications – useful to shut off email for set periods of time or on a schedule. The very act of turning it on helps me to get into work mode, and once running it enables me to work more deeply on tasks for longer. There are several open source alternatives that I’ve used in the past, but Freedom offers more control and customisation.

### 4\. Pomodoro timer

Depending on the task, the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) provides great results. You’ll need to experiment, but I find tedious tasks or reading articles and reports are perfect. Seriously applying the pomodoro technique also allows you to track and increase your focused work time.

I use an open source application called [Tomighty](https://tomighty.github.io/). There are more advanced options for Mac discussed [here](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-pomodoro-app-mac-ios/).

### Opportunities

Working from home offers an opportunity to experiment with new routines, workflows, habits, tools and ways of working. Through experimentation I’ve developed ways of [writing](https://jcransom.com/2018/02/02/academic-writing-workflow/), researching and managing flows of information that have worked well for me and I will post more about in the coming weeks.
