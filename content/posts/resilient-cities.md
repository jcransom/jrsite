Whilst working for UNESCO in Vietnam we hosted a training programme for senior Ministry of Education and Training staff on disaster risk reduction, looking at the role of policy makers in times of crisis. 35 officials were joined by two vice ministers, a crate of imported vodka and the excellent facilitation skills of [Moustafa Osman](https://osmanconsulting.wordpress.com/) in a countryside resort 50km from Hanoi. We argued that the education sector should be placed at the centre of national disaster risk reduction initiatives – not only is the maintenance of education during disasters a form of preserving ‘normality’ in times of crisis, but even small lapses in primary education can have long-term detrimental effects on individuals and society. And education itself can reduce a community’s vulnerability to disaster. Resilience in the education sector meant bringing the right people together, and ensuring they knew their roles and the roles of others in times of emergency. Specifically, that they would know what to do internally within the Ministry and externally with Departments of Education and Training at the local level in the area of disaster preparedness, response and recovery. ![Saigon2](https://ransomjc.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/saigon2.jpg)

### Resilient cities

I've been following with interest the [100 resilient cities](http://www.100resilientcities.org/) programme, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and 'dedicated to helping cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century'. Each of the 100 cities appoints a [Chief Resilience Officer](http://www.100resilientcities.org/blog/entry/what-is-a-chief-resilience-officer1#/-_/) as part of the programme. Just as the emphasis in the education sector in Vietnam was effective communication and liaison, one of the key tasks of the Chief Resilience Officer will be to work across government departments to help a city improve internal communications, and to bring together a wide array of stakeholders to learn about the city’s challenges. Universities should be active partners in the work of each of the 100 resilient cities. They often already have a good understanding of the complex systems that make up a city, already work with communities, businesses and other parts of the education system, and provide evidence and analysis on city assets and needs. Perhaps the greatest reason for universities contributing to resilience planning would be their long-term presence in cities - in some cases universities were founded hundreds of years ago, and they often plan decades ahead. As Michael Berkowitz, the president of the programme, said in an [interview](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/25/rockefeller-100-resilient-cities-washington-lagos-manchester-belfast) with the Guardian:

> The ultimate change we’re trying to see in cities – more cohesive communities, better infrastructure, more integrated planning, better mobility – these are things that happen over a generation, not just a couple of years. So one of the questions we’re asking now is how do you keep partnering with cities over an entire generation? Not just to 2020 but 2030, because that’s when we’ll see the kinds of change we’re really looking for.
