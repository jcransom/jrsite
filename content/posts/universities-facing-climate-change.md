Next week the Global University Leaders Council Hamburg holds its [biennial conference](https://www.guc-hamburg.de/about.html), this time looking at universities and climate change. Thereâ€™s a 150 page [edited volume supporting the event](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tristan-Mccowan/publication/353764763_Universities_facing_Climate_Change_and_Sustainability/links/61102add169a1a0103ea013e/Universities-facing-Climate-Change-and-Sustainability.pdf), including seven country case studies. I supported the production of this publication, through UCL Institute of Education.
