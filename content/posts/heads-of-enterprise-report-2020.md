Following [2018’s survey of heads of enterprise](https://jcransom.com/2019/04/09/entrepreneurship-in-uk-education/) in UK universities, and [2019’s survey of senior higher education leaders](https://jcransom.com/2019/10/04/views-on-the-future-of-higher-education-leadership/), we launched the university heads of enterprise report 2020 this morning, swapping the Houses of Parliament for Zoom.

Read the full report [online here](https://ncee.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NCEE-Enterprise-Survey-Report-2020.pdf) (PDF), and [get in contact](mailto:james.ransom@ncee.org.uk) to discuss assessing your university’s performance against the data.
