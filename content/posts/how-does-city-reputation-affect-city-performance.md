According to researchers studying 76 Spanish cities:

> we find that good city reputation is positively associated with economic activities and negatively with unemployment, but not related to net migration.

With the exception of city reputation having little association with net migration, these findings aren’t particularly surprising; indeed, the article is perhaps more notable as a sign of the emerging focus on ‘city reputation’ as a field of study. Full article in _Regional Studies_ available [here](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00343404.2017.1364358?af=R&journalCode=cres20). Incidentally, I was in Seville last week at EAIE, Europe’s largest higher education conference, presenting research on cities, universities and internationalisation, including city marketing and branding activities. See a _Times Higher Education_ piece briefly covering the session [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/global-higher-education-massive-business-serving-1) (towards the end). The _Regional Studies_ authors propose several areas of future investigation, including the dynamics of human capital (‘city reputation may attract human capital, which in turn favours city performance’). They would do well to also consider the effect of university performance and reputation on the city. [Photo by Johan Mouchet on Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/seville?photo=Wt6i4PhG_2k)
