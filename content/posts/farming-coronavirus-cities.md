In a post today on [six ways coronavirus will change our world](https://www.exponentialview.co/p/-six-ways-coronavirus-will-change), Azeem Azhar writes that the coronavirus might encourage self-sufficiency, especially around food, energy and products:

> Vertical farming could allow some kind of food sustainability at a community or city level. As it is, advanced hydroponic vertical farms use fewer water resources and have lower transport miles than traditional crops. Often they are pesticide and herbicide-free. Here is one example of vertical farms being rolled out to some [US campus universities](https://www.foodbev.com/news/freight-farms-sodexo-to-bring-vertical-farming-to-us-universities/), presumably for those students who don’t do beer and pizza. (Japan seems to have [taken the lead in vertical farming](https://www.ft.com/content/f80ea9d0-21a8-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b), according to the _FT_.)

Universities have taken the lead in developing urban farming solutions. I discuss this (as an ‘unsung hero’ of ‘smart’ cities) in my British Council [report](https://jcransom.com/2019/05/15/smart-places-report/). The twist here, of course, is the potential focus on quarantine and self-sufficiency, rather than sustainability and environmental protection. Such a movement might seem at odds with much of the narrative about cities (spun by both mayors and many urban commentators) as being open, interdependent and simultaneously local and global, but perhaps better reflects a shift towards locally-produced goods and globally-shared knowledge. As Azeem adds, the powerful response of the scientific community, and the open sourcing of intelligence in tackling the virus, bodes well for addressing future cross-border challenges (good coverage of the rapid response in _The Economist_ [here](https://www.economist.com/international/2020/02/06/the-race-to-produce-a-vaccine-for-the-latest-coronavirus)).
