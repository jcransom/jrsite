I was fortunate to join Professor Edward Peck, Vice-Chancellor of Nottingham Trent University, and Mihnea Costiou, Rector of Politehnica University of Bucharest, as part of a panel chaired by Bianka Stege, Director of Education and Society (EU Region), British Council at last weekâ€™s Going Global conference in London. The panel focused on the internationalisation of cities, and I presented new research funded by the British Council. You can see the slides and listen to the audio [here](https://www.britishcouncil.org/going-global/programme/sessions/internationalising-cities-mutual-influence). A summary of the research is provided as part of the highlights of day three [here](https://www.britishcouncil.org/going-global/programme/highlights/highlights-day-3), and _Times Higher Education_ covered the research [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/marginalised-must-be-winners-from-university-internationalisation). The full report is embargoed until the UK general election, but will be published after June 8th.

> Update: the report is [now available](http://bit.ly/mutualinfluencereport). I also wrote an article for _[The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/universities-have-the-power-to-create-exciting-connected-and-inclusive-cities-heres-how-81780)_ and _[Times Higher Education](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/marginalised-must-be-winners-from-university-internationalisation)_ covered the research.
