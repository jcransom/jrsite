Giorgio Marinoni and Hans de Wit [ask](https://ejournals.bc.edu/index.php/ihe/article/view/11187) in a recent edition of _International Higher Education_ whether ‘the internationalisation of higher education has become a strategic process at higher education institutions (HEIs) around the world’. They correctly note that having a strategy does not mean having a strategic approach. Drawing on a survey of 907 universities from 126 countries, they conclude that 'the presence of an institution-wide policy/strategy for internationalisation, as well as the presence of a dedicated office or team to oversee its implementation, are becoming the norm at HEIs around the world’. Both the presence of a strategy and of dedicated teams have grown significantly over the past 15 years, according to previous survey data. However, the development of monitoring frameworks has ‘stagnated’, and the authors find a risk of a gulf opening up between those institutions who choose to (and can afford to be) strategic about internationalisation, and those who are less engaged. These discussions build on two related strands of work I’ve been involved with in the past: [universities working with cities on internationalisation](https://jcransom.com/2017/07/02/the-future-of-european-internationalisation/) (with a central conclusion being a need for ‘strategic internationalisation’), and the [ineffectiveness of many university engagement strategies](https://jcransom.com/2018/11/22/how-to-write-engagement-strategy/). On the latter, and with a UK-focus, [this post](https://www.hepi.ac.uk/2019/04/19/the-future-for-university-strategies/) on the HEPI blog is worth a read: ‘almost 63% of university strategies have end dates in 2019, 2020 or 2021 and hence will need to be re-written and re-launched over the next few years’. _([Image credit: Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/84kSEqVBuvA))_
