Today’s Economist has an [article](http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21720647-dons-have-eye-modern-architecture-can-they-plan-citys-expansion-too-oxford) on the University of Oxford’s property development plans - in particular, building new housing.

> Homes in Oxford are among the least affordable in Britain. The housing pinch is keenly felt by postdoctoral researchers, 4,500 of whom work in Oxford on short-term contracts with unspectacular pay. The university realised that these academic serfs, who form the backbone of its intellectual project, were spending huge amounts of their income on rent and that if it wanted to remain competitive it would have to find them more places to live.

Many UK cities outside of London have a shortage of skilled workers (and London too has skills shortages in particular areas). Cities and universities are hungry for more people. Infrastructural weaknesses - from dodgy travel connections to a lack of quality and affordable housing - can act as bottlenecks to future growth and obstacles to attracting talented people. The issues facing universities are often shared by the city they are in. Many European cities have ambitious growth plans. Some want to revitalise particular districts, others recognise they need another 200,000 people to become truly competitive. Where countries have targets in place to, for example, double the number of international students, cities and universities need to work together to accommodate new arrivals. I’ll be [presenting new research](https://www.britishcouncil.org/events/internationalising-cities-mutual-influence) on how universities and cities are working together on internationalisation, including addressing shared infrastructure challenges, at [Going Global](https://www.britishcouncil.org/going-global) in May this year in London.
