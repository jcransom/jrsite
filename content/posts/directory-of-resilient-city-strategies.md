The [100 Resilient Cities programme](https://jcransom.com/2016/06/18/resilient-cities/) resembled a large-scale urban experiment, with the strategies that many of the cities produced offering a rich source of information for analysis. Over 80 final strategies have been published; although cities from North America are overrepresented, there is broad geographic coverage.

A few of the 80+ strategies published by city governments

As the previous iteration of the programme [has ended](https://jcransom.com/2019/08/13/the-demise-of-100-resilient-cities/), academic analyses of the strategies have continued to grow. For example, [Taylor et al.](https://doi.org/10.1080/00343404.2020.1760235) (2020) use latent content analysis to assess how the resilience strategies of 14 cities in Europe, North America and Oceania conceptualise future uncertainty. [Fitzgibbons and Mitchell](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.06.021) (2019) examine the extent to which 31 resilience strategies focus on social equity and justice using content analysis; their sample included cities from the Global South and North.

[I have compiled a spreadsheet of all the published strategies here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C32dyladdTqWM0PIynpXLtgC9YsqCg-zFo6O_MVsLHk/edit?usp=sharing) (last updated July 2020). Please feel free to add any that I have missed. At the time of writing the 100 Resilient Cities website (home to most of the strategies) appears to be offline, so [let me know](mailto:james.ransom.16@ucl.ac.uk) if you would like access to the complete set of strategies, which I have both as PDFs and plain text files.
