### Ghana faces a set of challenges similar to many emerging nations...

Ghana is an ['African Lion'](https://www.wider.unu.edu/publication/african-lions-ghanas-job-creation-successes-and-obstacles): a fast-growing economy, falling levels of vulnerable employment and rising productive employment led to Ghana becoming a lower-middle income country in 2007. However, there are [skills gaps](https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/wp2015-140.pdf) in the areas of medicine and health, engineering and technical skills, limited job opportunities in the formal sector for those leaving university, and the proportion of the labour force leaving tertiary education rose just 2 percent to 5.4 percent from 1992 to 2013.

### ...including the transition to a 'knowledge economy'

In a [paper](http://includeplatform.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/GTF-Skills-Development-in-Ghana-SR-formatted.compressed.pdf) submitted to the African Center for Economic Transformation, Baah-Boateng and Baffour-Awuah lament the gap that opened in per capita income between Ghana and South Korea from 1950 - when incomes were broadly similar - to today, when South Korea's output is six times higher. They cite a World Bank paper that suggests 'at least half of the difference is due to South Korea’s success in acquiring and using knowledge'. Their paper finishes with a strong set of policy recommendations (that are applicable nearly anywhere in the world), including the participation of industry in curriculum design, more internships during courses, placing university staff in industry, and government intervention to subside expensive technical courses at public universities.[1](#fn-484-1) As I've noted before, creating better jobs requires making [difficult decisions](https://jcransom.com/2015/04/01/working-for-economic-transformation/) in education policy to match labour market demand. ![Ghana](https://ransomjc.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/ghana.jpg)

### Ghana is a case study of global urbanisation...

In 2015 51.9 percent of Ghana’s population lived in urban areas, broadly similar to 54 percent globally in 2014. Ghana's urban population will reach 72.3 percent by 2050, in line with 70 percent globally. Urbanisation is moving [much faster](http://unhabitat.org/addressing-rapid-urbanization-challenges-in-the-greater-accra-region-an-action-oriented-approach/) than planning.

### ...which will bring challenges universities can help solve

UN Habitat [recommends](http://unhabitat.org/addressing-rapid-urbanization-challenges-in-the-greater-accra-region-an-action-oriented-approach/) government collaboration with universities in Ghana to improve planning and to address sustainable urban planning principles. Accra, for example, is at risk of flooding and - as [Rotterdam](https://jcransom.com/2016/07/01/the-future-is-local-rotterdam/) has demonstrated - universities can help city planners to simultaneously prepare against disasters and create a better place to live and work. In the Greater Accra region, 40 kilometres from the capital, the new urban area of Ningo-Prampram is rapidly growing. Urban strategies [stress](http://unhabitat.org/addressing-rapid-urbanization-challenges-in-the-greater-accra-region-an-action-oriented-approach/) the 'very limited timeframe to avoid unplanned sprawl and transform Ningo-Prampram into a thriving and prosperous compact, connected, socially inclusive and resilient city, which would be a sustainable development example for the country of Ghana and for the region as a whole'. A 'university city' in the northeast would offer 'residential areas and services for students, professors and researchers, developing innovative agriculture and forestry processes that are tested in the fertile central park and the northern irrigation lands, improving crop production and fostering food security'. This is an excellent example of the campus working with the city to test new ideas before rolling them out further - seen elsewhere in the form of [smart campuses](https://jcransom.com/2016/08/01/smart-campuses/).
