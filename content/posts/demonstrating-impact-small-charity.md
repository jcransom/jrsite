I had the good fortune to be sat next to David Chaplin on a flight from Rwanda last year. David is the founder of [Rwanda Action](https://www.rwanda-action.org/), a charity working in the rural districts of Nyamasheke and Rusizi in the west of the country to tackle deeply-entrenched poverty.

Rwanda Action takes a long-term approach to development, testing new approaches to address challenges identified by the community. Through careful monitoring and evaluation, the team of Rwandan staff work with the community and government to adopt and scale up these solutions.

The team are determined to ensure that all their interventions are validated by rigorous and substantial evidence. Since meeting David, I have helped with evaluating their innovative school-based mentor project, which works with teachers in 250 Rwandan schools, and producing impact reports for the charity’s activity in 2019 and 2020.

You can [read Rwanda Action’s impact reports here](https://www.rwanda-action.org/reports). This also marks the first time I have offered an end-to-end service from data analysis and report writing to full design and typesetting. Such an approach is ideally suited to smaller organisations looking for independent and clear analysis within a tight timescale.
