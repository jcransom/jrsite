The Royal Society launched a policy briefing on research and innovation clusters today – I provided support for the analysis and wrote the case studies for Israel, Pittsburgh, and Uppsala.

[The report is online here](http://royalsociety.org/research-innovation-clusters), and there’s a blog by Professor Richard Jones on _Wonkhe_ introducing the report: [can research clusters help level up the country?](https://wonkhe.com/blogs/can-research-clusters-help-level-up-the-country/) Research Professional also [has coverage](https://www.researchprofessional.com/0/rr/news/uk/charities-and-societies/2020/9/Level-up-by-expanding-R-D-clusters--says-Royal-Society.html) (paywalled article).
