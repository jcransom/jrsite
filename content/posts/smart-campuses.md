India wants [100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Cities_Mission) of them. China had [193](http://web.mit.edu/cron/project/CUPUM2015/proceedings/Content/pss/291_li_h.pdf) pilots of these running in 2013. At the moment they are largely conceptual, little known by the average person on the street, mostly 'captured' by commercial interests, and, as I've written about [before](https://jcransom.com/2016/04/01/how-universities-can-help-smart-cities-become-transformative-and-why-leapfrogging-is-difficult/), we are still some way from realising their transformative potential. But smart city initiatives will be an important part of future city development. Universities can help shift smart cities from being merely a good idea to providing everyday benefit to citizens. They can do this through smart campuses - developing the principles of smart cities on a limited geographic area, testing new infrastructure and implementing lessons learned, drawing in students and researchers, and then working with city officials to roll these out more widely. The University of Glasgow is [expanding its campus](http://www.gla.ac.uk/about/campus/overview/smartcampus/) by 25% over ten years. The university is working with the Future Cities Catapult on a [project](http://futurecities.catapult.org.uk/project/smart-campus-university-of-glasgow/) to 'develop a strategy for a Smart Campus that will take into account changes in technology and learning whilst also protecting their heritage (both cultural and physical) and realising cost savings'. The Catapult has developed a definition of the smart campus that supports the university’s new strategy:

> The Smart Campus actively learns from and adapts to the needs of its people and place, unlocking the potential of e technology and enabling world-changing learning and research.

Other universities have been working on smart campus projects. The University of Nottingham [plans](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/impetus/documents/smart-campus-uon.pdf) to develop a smart campus that is ‘efficient, safe, sustainable, responsive and enjoyable place to live and work, underpinned and enhanced by digital / internet based technologies’. They see the campus as ‘an ideal vehicle’ for researching, developing and evaluating a ‘diversity’ of smart city concepts, especially as the university is multi-site and encircles a major hospital. The project has attracted the interest of Nottingham City Council. A [case study](http://www.slideshare.net/ishahrour/smart-campus-an-effective-concept-for-the-smart-city-wb-may-2014) of the University of Lille presented to the World Bank in 2014 applies elements of smart cities – smart sensors, smart data analysis – to a university campus based in a city. The angle of this presentation seems to suggest the campus could act as a city in microcosm and thus be a good test case for wider implementation, for example managing water, energy and transport on campus. There would also be other benefits to embedding ‘smart’ on a campus: immediate access to expertise and researchers, reinforcing partnerships with local government and with the private sector, and capturing learning in new education programmes that could be delivered to students alongside implementation on campus. Developing a smart campus is arguably easier than developing smart city, with most of the campus falling under the ownership of one institution. In essence, the presentation concludes, the smart campus could ‘promote the concept of smart city to the city’.

### Lessons

It's important to prepare students and staff (the campus equivalent of a city's residents) for smart campuses. After analysing the experiences of smart cities around the world, Nesta have [found](http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/rethinking-smart-cities-ground) that many ‘top down’ smart city ideas have failed to deliver on their promise, and that smart city planners need to take human behaviour as seriously as technology, and to invest in smart people, as well as smart technology.

> By blurring the public realm and the university estate, city residents can become involved in the development of smart cities

Local government and city leaders may be keen to test the concept of a smart city by supporting the development of a smart campus. By seeing campuses as ‘cities in microcosm’ the development of smart infrastructure can lead to closer working between universities and local leaders. And by softening the edges between a campus and a city, by opening up campuses as public spaces, providing community services and cultural events, by blurring the public realm and the university estate, other city residents can become involved in the development of smart cities. At the same time, universities can learn from the experience of smart cities. For example, whilst technology is an important component that underpins smart cities and campuses, they need to be developed with people at their core. Universities are ideally placed to both apply the lessons from smart cities in the development of smart campuses, and to ‘test’ smart infrastructure that can be rolled out to smart cities.
