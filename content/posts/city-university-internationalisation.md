Urban universities are increasingly framing their internationalisation activity through the lens of their city. Two parallel narratives help explain this shift: (1) a renewed acceptance of the importance of the local environment for university success in attracting staff and students and (2) the growing influence of cities as international actors. Read more in my short academic article published in _Compare: A Journal of Comparative and International Education_. [I have 50 free copies available by clicking this link](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/mzfM237mxmbbHD4kyG3Z/full); after these are gone it will revert to a paywall (unless you have access through an academic institution). Or you can read the [original British Council report](http://bit.ly/mutualinfluencereport) (or the even more [concise summary in The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/universities-have-the-power-to-create-exciting-connected-and-inclusive-cities-heres-how-81780)).

> In other news, the University of Toronto is launching a new [‘School of Cities’](http://www.schoolofcities.com/) that will ‘convene urban-focused researchers, educators, students, practitioners, and the general public to explore and address complex urban challenges’. This is particularly interesting in light of [my research](https://jcransom.com/2017/11/18/university-superpowers/) there last year, and the school joins a growing number of academic centres or institutes focused on global challenges and cities (three centres in the UK were recently established through the Global Challenges Research Fund - [see this PDF](https://www.ukri.org/files/legacy/gcrf-calls/growcallbookletjul2017-pdf/)). The Toronto school is modelled on [LSE Cities](https://lsecities.net/) ([‘we don’t have that kind of thing in Toronto right now’](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/05/07/u-of-ts-school-of-cities-looks-to-tackle-problems-of-growing-cities.html)).
