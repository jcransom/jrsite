Paul Krugman, Nobel prize winning economist and long-time columnist for The New York Times, is also one of the fathers of New Economic Geography. NEG is described as ‘One Economic Theory to Explain Everything’ by a Bloomberg columnist in [a handy explainer](http://origin-www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-01-08/one-economic-theory-to-explain-everything). Anyway, I was reading [a transcript](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1007/s10110-003-0180-0/abstract) of a conversation between Krugman and Masahisa Fujita (another parent of NEG) in the journal _Papers in Regional Science_. Just before the end there’s this helpful reminder of why protectionism and closed borders is so bad for cities:

> ...agglomeration of a large number of heterogeneous people (essentially, professional workers with heterogeneous skills/knowledge) in a city or industrial district can naturally be expected to contribute to the diffusion, generation/innovation, and accumulation of knowledge, and hence to economic growth. This would certainly be true in the short-run. But this is not assured in the long-run unless there is a sufficient infusion of new blood. (pp.161-162)

Economic growth relies upon new people who help to develop new ideas - clearly endangered by the likes of Brexit. On a lighter note, the transcript (recorded in Puerto Rico) ends as follows:

> K: Of course, I agree with you. But, ... I: Hey Paul! Why are standing up? Where are you going? K: Talking under the Caribbean sun for over two hours has literally fuelled my now burning desire to jump into that ocean. F: Yeah, all I can think of now is to savour this Caribbean moment with a quick dip and a large beer under the cool shade. K and F (in unison): Hasta la vista! _Sounds of two big splashes _ I: … Hey, Paul, Masa! Wait for me! _Another big splash is heard, followed by hearty laughter_
