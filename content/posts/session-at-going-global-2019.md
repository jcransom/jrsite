A recording of the smart cities session at Going Global 2019 in Berlin [is now available online](https://www.britishcouncil.org/going-global/programme/sessions/smart-cities-heis-leaders-partners), including my presentation of the report findings, panel discussion and questions from the audience. You can also find my (admittedly minimalist) slides at the above link. In related news, _University World News_ kindly re-published my summary of my earlier report on universities, cities and internationalisation [here](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20190517125153140). And if you missed it, the full report on universities and smart cities is on the British Council website [here](http://bit.ly/smartplacesreport). https://twitter.com/HEGoingGlobal/status/1128590887573950464
