In what now seems like the distant past, before the Brexit vote and the change of government, the House of Commons launched an [inquiry](http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/business-innovation-and-skills/inquiries/parliament-2015/power-houses-and-engines-15-16/) looking at the Northern Powerhouse and Midlands Engine and government policy towards regional growth. (You can read my thoughts on the Northern Powerhouse post-referendum [here](https://jcransom.com/2016/08/11/is-the-northern-powerhouse-dead/)). The written submissions to the inquiry have just been [published](http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/business-innovation-and-skills/inquiries/parliament-2015/power-houses-and-engines-15-16/publications/). Of the 50 submissions, a quick count suggests that least a quarter are written by a university, a university group, or an institute based out of a university. Clearly universities are taking the regional growth agenda seriously. Following the change of government, the committee will now look 'more broadly at Industrial Strategy, rather than focussing on specific regional models'. Hopefully some of the good practice and lessons learned around forming strong regional links will be taken forward. Work by Centre for Cities, looking at [lessons learned](http://www.centreforcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/16-05-31-Building-the-Northern-Powerhouse-Lessons-from-the-Rhine-Ruhr-and-Randstad.pdf) from the Rhine-Ruhr (Germany) and Randstad (Netherlands) regions, found that these areas were successful not because of transport connections between their respective cities, but that 'strong regional economies require strongly performing cities at their heart', with a high concentration of knowledge-based businesses and highly skilled workers. This perhaps explains the high level of university engagement with regional policy in the UK. The Rhine-Ruhr and Randstad regions were part of the inspiration for the Northern Powerhouse. Hopefully the importance of knowledge and skills as the basis for strong economies won't be lost with a wider focus on Industrial Strategy rather than specific regional models.
