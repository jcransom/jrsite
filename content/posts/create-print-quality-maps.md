I’ve always been a fan of maps, from an illustrated [picture atlas of the world](https://www.amazon.com/Picture-Atlas-World-Brian-Delf/dp/0528835645) that I used to pore over as a child, to a battered USSR-era Cyrillic map of Somalia that I bought from an antique store in Estonia. I also enjoy reading about maps - from the excellent exposition of global politics via ten maps in [Prisoners of Geography](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00Y16BEM2/) to articles about the [creation of Google Maps](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/how-google-builds-its-maps-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-everything/261913/). It turns out creating maps is also quite fun. In the past I have used online tools such as [Stamen maps](http://maps.stamen.com), using OpenStreetMap data, or the Google Maps-based [Snazzy Maps](https://snazzymaps.com/). But for bespoke print-quality map creation you need to turn to GIS software.

Introducing QGIS and Natural Earth Data
---------------------------------------

I was inspired to try QGIS, an open source programme available to download [here](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/), after reading an [interview with Steven Bernard](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/about/case_studies/qgis_at_financial_times.html), Interactive Design Editor at the Financial Times, and seeing examples of the finished maps he had created. Steven has an excellent [YouTube walkthrough guide](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7HotvlLKHCs9nD1fFUjSOsZrsnctyV2R) that I recommend following from start to finish. It takes you through [downloading QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/) and installing [Natural Earth data](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/) to advanced styling and designing animated markers. You build upon a blank map of the world: ![Map 01](https://ransomjc.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/map-01.jpeg) Which quickly grows in complexity: ![Map 02](https://ransomjc.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/map-02.png) I needed to create a map showing four specific European cities, and so the map needed refining and tidying. Here’s the final map in QGIS: ![](https://ransomjc.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/map-03-a0c5effc2b15411794596ef3f780285b.png) Which can then be exported at print resolution, or (in this case) exported as a SVG file for editing in a vector graphics programme. This allows the labels to be adjusted and other visual tweaks made. QGIS is a hugely powerful program offering a great deal of customisation. The [user manual](http://qgis.org/en/docs/index.html) is 420 pages and perhaps best works as a backup reference, with the [YouTube walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7HotvlLKHCs9nD1fFUjSOsZrsnctyV2R) offering an accessible way to jump in and create your first map.
