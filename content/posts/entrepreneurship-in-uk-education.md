The National Centre for Entrepreneurship in Education (NCEE) launched the _Inspiring Entrepreneurship in Education_ report last week at the House of Lords, capturing the views of 62 Heads of Enterprise from UK universities (I provided the analysis). https://twitter.com/nceeUK/status/1114090520026976256 The report was covered by [_Times Higher Education_](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/support-entrepreneurship-uk-universities-freefall) (paywall article), who led with the finding that university support for enterprise in local schools and communities has significantly decreased in the past six years. The full report [here](https://ncee.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NCEE-Inspiring-Entrepreneurship-in-Education-2018.pdf) (PDF) covers a wide range of activity and indicators, perhaps best summed up by this visual heat map from the annex. The first column is 2018 activity and the second column 2012 data, and greener is better: ![](https://ransomjc.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/nceeannexa.png)![](https://ransomjc.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/nceeannexb.png) The article ends by summing up the report conclusions focusing on local activity:

> The report also recommends that universities consider how existing activity and the work of students in particular could engage with schools and communities, and that staff promote the work of local entrepreneurs, in preference to tales of high-profile examples such as Mark Zuckerberg and Richard Branson, to make entrepreneurship seem more accessible to students.

The final recommendation in particular was also echoed by Professor Alison Wolf, Baroness of Dulwich, who also spoke at the event. https://twitter.com/UELEnterprise/status/1113868284926017536
