In 2018 I spoke at a [workshop](https://urbaninstitute.gsu.edu/2018/09/27/locating-the-urban-university-international-dialogues-with-south-african-policy-and-practice/) on urban universities in South Africa, organised by Georgia State University’s Urban Studies Institute and South Africa’s Human Sciences Research Council. My slides and related thoughts from the event are on the blog [here](https://jcransom.com/2018/10/24/six-stages-engagement/), but there’s also been a flurry of recent press coverage of the discussions, including good summaries in the South African newspaper [Mail & Guardian](https://mg.co.za/article/2019-01-18-00-shaping-cities-goes-beyond-student-beds%20) and [University World News](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20190125082635459). South Africa faces tremendous challenges and opportunities that quickly become clear when looking at the development of the higher education system and of urban areas. For example, issues such as student housing in cities are deeply tied into issues of access, identity and opportunity in society. _International Higher Education_ recently published a [good summary](https://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/ihe/article/view/10780/9273) (open access) of the forces that have rocked South African universities in recent years, and the impact this has across the continent. And University World News rounded out the coverage of the Cape Town event with two other pieces on universities and development in South Africa [here](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20190122063623313) and [here](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20190122082913457), which are worth a read.
